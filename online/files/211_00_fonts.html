<h1>Fonts</h1>
When you want to draw text in your game this text is drawn in an
Arial 12 points font. To make more fancy looking texts you probably
want to use different fonts. To use different fonts you must create
font resources. In each font resource you specify a particular type
of font which can then be used in your game using the action to set
a font.

<p>To create a font resource in your game, use the item <b>Create
Font</b> in the <b>Resources</b> menu or use the corresponding
button on the toolbar. The following form will pop up.</p>

<p><img src="images/form_font.jpg">
</p>

<p>As always you should give your font resource a name. Next you
can pick the name of the font. Also you can indicate its size and
whether it should be bold and/or italic. Realize that large fonts
take a lot of memory to store. So you are strongly recommended not
to use fonts with a size larger than say 32. (It is possible to
scale the fonts while running the game.) An example of the
indicated font is shown at the bottom.</p>

<p>A font typically consist of 256 characters, numbered from 0 to
255. But in general you use only a small portion of these. So
default in a font only the characters from 32 till 127 are stored
in the font. The more characters you store in the font the more
memory it will use. You can change the character range used. To see
the index of each character you can use the Character Map that can
be found in the Windows Start menu under Accessories/System Tools.
Some standard ranges can be indicated using the buttons: The
<b>Normal</b> range from 32 till 127, the <b>All</b> range from 0
till 255, the <b>Digits</b> range that only contains the 10 digits,
and the <b>Letters</b> range that contains all uppercase and
lowercase letters. Other ranges can be used by typing in the first
and last character index. If a character does not lie in the range
it is replaced by a space.</p>

<p>Normally you have a large number of different fonts installed on
your computer and there are websites where you can download
hundreds more. The problem is that if you use them in your game and
then give your game to somebody else to play there is a big chance
that the other person does not have the same fonts installed on his
or her computer. To avoid this, <i>Game Maker</i> embeds all the
fonts you want to use in the game file, but only in the stand-alone
games. So if you give a stand-alone game to someone else you don't
need to provide the font files. But if you give somebody the
editable version of your game and you use fancy fonts, you better
also provide the person with the correct font files.</p>

<p>The <b>Anti-Aliasing</b> drop box allows you to specify the
level of anti-aliasing applied to the font.&nbsp; There are 4
levels from 0 to 3. You will currently have to run the game in
order to see the fully anti-aliased font.</p>

<p>You can also select the <b>Character Set</b> codepage the font
uses, and this will allow basic multi-languge support.</p>

<p>Please note that the render window does not currently show the
current character or AA selection, it's simply a sample of the
FONT.</p>
