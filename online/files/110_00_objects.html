<h1>Defining objects</h1>
With the resources you have seen so far you can add some nice
images and sounds to the game, but they don't do anything. We now
come to the most important resource of <i>Game Maker</i>, the
objects. Objects are entities in the game that do things. Most of
the time they have a sprite as a graphical representation so that
you see them. They have behavior because they can react to certain
events. All things you see in the game (except for the background)
are objects. (Or to be more precise, they are instances of
objects.) The characters, the monsters, the balls, the walls, etc.
are all objects. There might also be certain objects that you don't
see but which control certain aspects of the game play.

<p>Please realize the difference between sprites and objects.
Sprites are just (animated) images that don't have any behavior.
Objects normally have a sprite to represent them but objects have
behavior. Without objects there is no game!</p>

<p>Also realize the difference between objects and instances. An
object describes a certain entity, e.g. a monster. There can be
multiple instances of this object in the game. When we talk about
an instance we mean one particular instance of the object. When we
talk about an object we mean all the instances of this object.</p>

<p>To create an object in your game, choose <b>Create Object</b>
from the <b>Resources</b> menu. The following form will appear:</p>

<p><img src="images/form_object.jpg">
</p>

<p>This is rather complex. At the left there is some general
information about the object. In the middle there is the list of
events that can happen to the object. At the right there are the
different actions the object can perform. Events and actions will
be discussed in the coming chapters.</p>

<p>As always, you can (and should) give your object a name. Next
you can choose the sprite for the object. To this end, click with
the left mouse button on the sprite box or the menu button next to
it. A menu will pop-up with all the available sprites. Select the
one you want to use for the object. If you do not have a sprite
yet, you can click the button <b>New</b> to create a new sprite
resource and change it. Also, when you select a resource there will
be a button <b>Edit</b> here that you can use to change the sprite.
This is faster than first finding the resource in the list of
resources and then indicating you want to edit it.</p>

<p>Below this there are two check boxes. <b>Visible</b> indicates
whether instances of this object are visible. Clearly, most objects
are visible, but sometimes it is useful to have invisible objects.
For example, you can use them for waypoints for a moving monster.
Invisible objects will react to events and other instances do
collide with them. The box labeled <b>Solid</b> indicates whether
this is a solid object (like a wall). Collisions with solid objects
are treated differently from collisions with non-solid objects. You
are strongly advised to use <b>Solid</b> only for object that are
not moving.</p>

var fe = FindFrame("toc", top);

  if (chmtop.c2wtopf.FITEMS[chmtop.c2wtopf.pagenum] != chmtop.c2wtopf.pageid)
    chmtop.c2wtopf.jstree.OpenTreeNode("" + chmtop.c2wtopf.pageid);
