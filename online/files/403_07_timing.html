<h3>Timing</h3>
Good games require careful timing of things happening. Fortunately
<i>Game Maker</i> does most of the timing for you. It makes sure
things happen at a constant rate. This rate is defined when
defining the rooms. But you can change it using the global variable
room_speed. So for example, you can slowly increase the speed of
the game, making it more difficult, by adding a very small amount
(like 0.001) to room_speed in every step. If your machine is slow
the game speed might not be achieved. This can be checked using the
variable fps that constantly monitors the actual number of frames
per second. Finally, for some advanced timing you can use the
variable current_time that gives the number of milliseconds since
the computer was started. Here is the total collection of variables
available (only the first one can be changed):

<blockquote><tt><b>room_speed</b></tt> Speed of the game in the
current room (in steps per second).<br>
<tt><b>fps*</b></tt> Number of frames that are actually drawn per
second.<br>
<tt><b>current_time*</b></tt> Number of milliseconds that have
passed since the system was started.<br>
<tt><b>current_year*</b></tt> The current year.<br>
<tt><b>current_month*</b></tt> The current month.<br>
<tt><b>current_day*</b></tt> The current day.<br>
<tt><b>current_weekday*</b></tt> The current day of the week
(1=sunday, ..., 7=saturday).<br>
<tt><b>current_hour*</b></tt> The current hour.<br>
<tt><b>current_minute*</b></tt> The current minute.<br>
<tt><b>current_second*</b></tt> The current
second.<br></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you might want to stop the game for a short while. For
this, use the sleep function.</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>sleep(numb)</b></tt> Sleeps numb
milliseconds.<br></blockquote>

<p>As you should know, every instance has 12 different alarm clocks
that you can set. To change the values (or get the values) of the
different alarm clocks use the following variable:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>alarm[0..11]</b></tt> Value of the indicated
alarm clock. (Note that alarm clocks only get updated when the
alarm event for the object contains actions!)<br></blockquote>

<p>We have seen that for complex timing issues you can use the time
line resource. Each instance can have a time line resource
associated with it. The following variables deal with this:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>timeline_index</b></tt> Index of the time line
associated with the instance. You can set this to a particular time
line to use that one. Set it to -1 to stop using a time line for
the instance. Note that this does not start the time line. For this
use the variable <tt>timeline_running</tt>.<br>
<tt><b>timeline_position</b></tt> Current position within the time
line. You can change this to skip certain parts or to repeat
parts.<br>
<tt><b>timeline_speed</b></tt> Normally, in each step the position
in the time line is increased by 1. You can change this amount by
setting this variable to a different value. You can use real
numbers like 0.5. If the value is larger than one, several moments
can happen within the same time step. They will all be performed in
the correct order, so no actions will be skipped. You can also use
a negative value to let the time line play backwards.<br>
<tt><b>timeline_running</b></tt> Indicates whether the time line is
running (true) or paused or stopped (false). You can change this
variable to run or stop the time line.<br>
<tt><b>timeline_looping</b></tt> Indicated whether the time line is
looping (true) or not (false). You can change this variable to
switch looping on or off.</blockquote>
