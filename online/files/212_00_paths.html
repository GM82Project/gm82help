<h1>Paths</h1>
In more advanced games you often want to let instances follow
certain paths. Even though you can indicate this by e.g. using
timer events or code, this is rather complicated. Path resources
are an easier mechanism for this. The idea is rather simple. You
define a path by drawing it. Next you can place an action in the
creation event of the object to tell the object to follow the
particular path. This chapter will explain this in detail.

<h3>Defining paths</h3>
To create a path in your game, choose <b>Create Path</b> from the
<b>Resources</b> menu. The following form will pop up (in the
example we already added a little path).

<p><img src="images/form_path.jpg">
</p>

<p>At the top left of the form you can set the name of the path, as
usual. Below it you find the points that define the path. Each
point has both a position and a speed (indicated with sp).
Depending on how you use the path, the position is either absolute,
that is, the instance for which you will later use the path will
follow it at that particular place, or it is relative, that is, the
instance will always start at the first position on the path and
follow the path from there. The speed should be interpreted as
follows. A value of 100 means the original speed given for the path
when assigning it to the instance. A lower value reduces the speed,
a higher value increases it (so it indicates the percentage of the
actual speed). Speed will be interpolated between points, so the
speed changes gradually.</p>

<p>To add a point press the button <b>Add</b>. A copy is made of
the currently selected point. Now you can change the actual
position and speed by changing the values in the edit boxes.
Whenever you select a point in the list, you can also change its
values. Press <b>Insert</b> to insert a new point before the
current one, and <b>Delete</b> to delete the current point.</p>

<p>At the right of the form you will see the actual path. The red
dot indicates the currently selected control point. The blue dots
are the other control points. The green square indicates the
position where the path starts. You can also change the path using
the mouse. Click anywhere on the image to add a point. Click on an
existing point and drag it to change its position. When you hold
&lt;Shift&gt; while clicking on a point, you insert a point.
Finally, you can use the right mouse button to remove points. (Note
that you cannot change the speed this way.) Normally the points
will be aligned with a grid. You can change the grid settings at
the top tool bar. Here you can also indicate whether the grid
should be visible or not. If you want to precisely position a
point, hold the &lt;Alt&gt; key while adding or moving it.</p>

<p>You can influence the shape of the path in two ways. Fist of all
you can use the type of connection. You can either choose straight
line connections or a smooth path. Secondly, you can indicate
whether the path must be closed or not.</p>

<p>On the toolbar there are a number of important controls. From
left to right they have the following meaning. The first button
indicates that you are ready and want to close the form, keeping
the changes. (If you want to discard the changes, press the cross
to close the window and indicate that you do not want to save the
changes.) Next there is the button to undo the last change.</p>

<p>The following set of toolbar buttons allows you the clear the
path, reverse the order in which the path is traversed, shift the
path, mirror it horizontally, flip it vertically, rotate it, and
scale it. Next there are buttons to shift the view (not the path
itself; the actual view area is indicated in the status bar at the
bottom) and to center the view.&nbsp; You can also use the middle
mouse button to PAN around the view around</p>

<p>As already indicated above you can next set the snap values and
whether to show the grid. Finally there is a button to indicate
that you want to see a particular room as background for the path.
Using this you can easily put the path at a particular place in the
room, for example on a race track, so that later the instances will
follow the correct route. (This only makes sense when you use
absolute paths; see below.)</p>

<h3>Assigning paths to objects</h3>
To assign a path to an instance of an object, you can place the
path action in some event, for example in the creation event. In
this action you must specify the path from the drop down menu.
There are some further values you can provide.

<p>You must indicate the path that must be followed and the speed
in pixels per step. When the speed is positive the instance starts
at the beginning of the path. If it is negative it starts at the
end. Remember that when you defined the path you specify the actual
speed relative to this indicated speed. There is also an action to
change the speed with which the path is executed. You could, for
example, use this to let an instance slow down or speed up along
its path. Note that the normal speed of the instance is ignored
(actually set to 0) when executing a path. Also things like gravity
and friction do not influence the motion along a path.</p>

<p>Next you specify the end behavior, that is, what should happen
when the end of the path is reached. You can choose to stop the
motion and end the path. You can also restart the path from the
beginning, that is, the instance jumps back to the position where
the path was started and executes the path again. A third option is
to restart from the current position, that is, the instance follows
the path again but now with this new starting position (this is the
same when the path is closed). Finally you can choose to reverse
the motion, making the instance go back and forth along the path.
Note that also at the end of the path an event happens; see
below.</p>

<p>Finally you can indicate whether the path must be absolute or
relative. An absolute path is executed at the place where it is
defined. The instance is placed at the start position and moved
from there (end position when speed is negative). This is, for
example, useful when you have a race track on which you have
defined the path. When you choose relative the instances starts
executing the path from its current position. This is useful when
an instance should make a local motion. For example, space ships in
a space invader game can make a particular turn from their current
position.</p>

<p>When you want to place the instance at a different point along
its path you can use the action to set the path position. A path
position always lies between 0 and 1, 0 indicating the start
position and 1 the end position on the path. Note that in each step
the direction variable is automatically set to the correct
direction along the path. You can use this variable to choose the
correct orientation for the sprite.</p>

<p>When using scripts or pieces of code you have more control over
the way the path is executed. There is a function to start a path
for an instance. The variable <tt>path_position</tt> indicates the
current position on the path (between 0 and 1 as indicated above).
The variable <tt>path_speed</tt> indicates the speed along the
path. A variable <tt>path_scale</tt> can be used to scale the path.
A value of 1 is the original size. A larger value indicates that
the path is made larger; a smaller value makes it smaller. The
variable <tt>path_orientation</tt> indicates the orientation in
which the path is executed (in degrees counter-clockwise). This
enables you to execute the path in a different orientation (e.g.
moving up and down rather than left and right). There is also a
variable to control the end behavior. Finally there are lots of
functions to ask for properties of paths (e.g. the x and y
coordinate at a certain positions) and there are functions to
create paths. There are even functions that create collision free
paths for an instance to reach a certain goal. See the later
sections on GML for details on this.</p>

<p>You might wonder what happens when the instance collides with
another instance while it follows a path. Basically the same
happens as when the instance moves with a speed. When there is a
solid instance, the instance is placed back at its previous
location. When both instances are not solid they are placed at
their new positions Next the collision event(s) are executed and it
is checked whether the collision has been resolved. If not and the
other instance is solid the instance will stop, as it should
(assuming there is a collision event defined). Also, the
<tt>path_position</tt> variable is not increased. When the blocking
instance disappears the instance will continue to follow its path.
To handle collisions yourself the variable
<tt>path_positionprevious</tt> can be useful. It holds the previous
position for the path and you can set the path position to this
variable to avoid advancing along the path.</p>

<h3>The path event</h3>
As described above, you can indicate what must happen when the
instance reaches the end of the path. At this moment also an <b>End
of Path</b> event occurs. You can find it under the <b>Other</b>
events. Here you can place actions. For example, you might want to
destroy the instance, or let it start a new (different) path.
