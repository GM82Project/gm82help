<h3>Viewing the world</h3>
Default you look along the negative z-axis toward the middle of the
room. Often in 3D games you want to change how you look at the
world. For example, in a first person shooter you probably want to
have the camera look from a position a bit above the xy-plane along
the xy-plane. In graphics terms you are setting the correct
projection. To change the way you look the following two functions
exist.

<blockquote>
<tt><b>d3d_set_projection(xfrom,yfrom,zfrom,xto,yto,zto,xup,yup,zup)</b></tt>
Defines how to look in the world. You specify the point to look
from, the point to look to and the up vector.<br></blockquote>

<p>This function requires some explanation. To set the projection
you first need the position you look from. This is indicated by the
parameters <tt>(xfrom,yfrom,zfrom)</tt>. Next you must specify the
direction you look in. This is done by giving a second point to
look towards. This is the point <tt>(xto,yto,zto)</tt>. Finally,
you can still rotate the camera around the line from the viewpoint
to the looking point. To specify this we must give an up vector,
that is, the direction that is upwards in the camera. This is given
by the last three parameters <tt>(xup,yup,zup)</tt>. Let me given
an example. To look along the xy-plane as in a first person shooter
you can use</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  d3d_set_projection(100,100,10,200,100,10,0,0,1);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
So you look from point (100,100) and 10 above the plane in the
direction of (200,100). The up vector points is the z-direction as
required. To make this slightly more complicated, assume you have
an instance in your room that specifies the position of the camera.
It will have a current (x,y) position and a direction (and maybe
even a speed). You can now specify this as your camera by using the
following code:

<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  <b>with</b> (obj_camera)
    d3d_set_projection(x,y,10,
               x+cos(direction*pi/180),y-sin(direction*pi/180),10,
               0,0,1);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This might look a bit complicated. We look from the camera
position (x,y), 10 above the ground. To determine a point in the
correct direction we need to do a little arithmetic. This point is
indicated by the next three parameters. Finally we use the up
vector as above.</p>

<p>One important remark! When <i>Game Maker</i> starts drawing a
room it will set the view point back to the default position. So
the first thing you must do when drawing the scene is set is to the
projection you want. This must be done in a drawing event!</p>

<p>There is also an extended version of the function above:</p>

<blockquote>
<tt><b>d3d_set_projection_ext(xfrom,yfrom,zfrom,xto,yto,zto,xup,yup,zup,angle,aspect,znear,zfar)</b></tt>
An extended version of this function in which you also specify the
angle defining the field of view, the aspect ratio between
horizontal and vertical size of the view, and the near and far
clipping planes.<br></blockquote>

<p>The additional parameters work as follows. If you specified the
camera position, point to look at, and up vector, you can still
change how wide the lens of the camera is. This is called the field
of view. A reasonable value is somewhere between 40 and 45 degrees.
But you can change this if you like. Next you can specify the
aspect ratio between the horizontal and vertical projection.
Normally you want to use the same as the aspect ration of the room
or view, e.g. 640/480. Finally you can indicate the clipping
planes. Objects that are closer than <tt>znear</tt> to the camera
are not drawn. Similar for objects further than <tt>zfar</tt>. It
can be important to set these parameters to reasonable values
because they also influence the precision of the z-comparisons. If
you make the range too large the precision gets worse. Default we
use 1 and 32000. <tt>znear</tt> must be larger than 0!</p>

<p>Sometimes you temporarily need a normal orthographic projection
as is used when there is no 3D. Or you want to return to the
default perspective projection. For this you can use the following
functions:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>d3d_set_projection_ortho(x,y,w,h,angle)</b></tt>
Sets a normal orthographic projection of the indicated area in the
room, rotated over the indicated angle.<br>
<tt><b>d3d_set_projection_perspective(x,y,w,h,angle)</b></tt> Sets
a normal perspective projection of the indicated area in the room,
rotated over the indicated angle.<br></blockquote>

<p>A standard use for this is to draw an overlay to e.g. show the
score or other aspects. To do so we set an orthographic projection.
We also must temporarily switch off hidden surface removal cause we
want the information to be drawn regardless of the current depth
value. The following example shows how to create an overlay with
the score.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  draw_set_color(c_black);
  d3d_set_projection_ortho(0,0,room_width,room_height,0);
  d3d_set_hidden(false);
  draw_text(10,10,'Score: ' + string(score));
  d3d_set_hidden(true);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
