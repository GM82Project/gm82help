<h3>Moving around</h3>
Obviously, an important aspect of games is the moving around of
object instances. Each instance has two built-in variables x and y
that indicate the position of the instance. (To be precise, they
indicate the place where the origin of the sprite is placed.
Position (0,0) is the top-left corner of the room. You can change
the position of the instance by changing its x and y variables. If
you want the object to make complicated motions this is the way to
go. You typically put this code in the step event for the object.

<p>If the object moves with constant speed and direction, there is
an easier way to do this. Each object instance has a horizontal
speed (<tt>hspeed</tt>) and a vertical speed (<tt>vspeed</tt>).
Both are indicated in pixels per step. A positive horizontal speed
means a motion to the right, a negative horizontal speed mean a
motion to the left. Positive vertical speed is downwards and
negative vertical speed is upwards. So you have to set these
variables only once (for example in the creating event) to give the
object instance a constant motion.</p>

<p>There is quite a different way for specifying motion, using a
direction (in degrees 0-359), and a speed (should be non-negative).
You can set and read these variables to specify an arbitrary
motion. (Internally this is changed into values for <tt>hspeed</tt>
and <tt>vspeed</tt>.) Also there is the friction and the gravity
and gravity direction. Finally, there is the function
<tt>motion_add(dir,speed)</tt> to add a motion to the current
one.</p>

<p>To be complete, each instance has the following variables and
functions dealing with its position and motion:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>x</b></tt> Its x-position.<br>
<tt><b>y</b></tt> Its y-position.<br>
<tt><b>xprevious</b></tt> Its previous x-position.<br>
<tt><b>yprevious</b></tt> Its previous y-position.<br>
<tt><b>xstart</b></tt> Its starting x-position in the room.<br>
<tt><b>ystart</b></tt> Its starting y-position in the room.<br>
<tt><b>hspeed</b></tt> Horizontal component of the speed.<br>
<tt><b>vspeed</b></tt> Vertical component of the speed.<br>
<tt><b>direction</b></tt> Its current direction (0-360,
counter-clockwise, 0 = to the right).<br>
<tt><b>speed</b></tt> Its current speed (pixels per step).<br>
<tt><b>friction</b></tt> Current friction (pixels per step).<br>
<tt><b>gravity</b></tt> Current amount of gravity (pixels per
step).<br>
<tt><b>gravity_direction</b></tt> Direction of gravity (270 is
downwards).<br>
<tt><b>motion_set(dir,speed)</b></tt> Sets the motion with the
given speed in direction dir.<br>
<tt><b>motion_add(dir,speed)</b></tt> Adds the motion to the
current motion (as a vector addition).<br></blockquote>

<p>There are a large number of functions available that help you in
defining your motions:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>place_free(x,y)</b></tt> Returns whether the
instance placed at position(x,y) is collision-free. This is
typically used as a check before actually moving to the new
position.<br>
<tt><b>place_empty(x,y)</b></tt> Returns whether the instance
placed at position (x,y) meets nobody. So this function takes also
non-solid instances into account.<br>
<tt><b>place_meeting(x,y,obj)</b></tt> Returns whether the instance
placed at position (x,y) meets obj. obj can be an object in which
case the function returns true is some instance of that object is
met. It can also be an instance id, the special word all meaning an
instance of any object, or the special word other.<br>
<tt><b>place_snapped(hsnap,vsnap)</b></tt> Returns whether the
instance is aligned with the snapping values.<br>
<tt><b>move_random(hsnap,vsnap)</b></tt> Moves the instance to a
free random, snapped position, like the corresponding action.<br>
<tt><b>move_snap(hsnap,vsnap)</b></tt> Snaps the instance, like the
corresponding action.<br>
<tt><b>move_wrap(hor,vert,margin)</b></tt> Wraps the instance when
it has left the room to the other side. <tt>hor</tt> indicates
whether to wrap horizontaly and <tt>vert</tt> indicates whether to
wrap vertically. <tt>margin</tt> indicates how far the origin of
the instance must be outside the room before the wrap happens. So
it is a margin around the room. You typically use this function in
the Outside event.<br>
<tt><b>move_towards_point(x,y,sp)</b></tt> Moves the instances with
speed sp toward position (x,y).<br>
<tt><b>move_bounce_solid(adv)</b></tt> Bounces against solid
instances, like the corresponding action. adv indicates whether to
use advance bounce, that also takes slanted walls into account.<br>
<tt><b>move_bounce_all(adv)</b></tt> Bounces against all instances,
instead of just the solid ones.<br>
<tt><b>move_contact_solid(dir,maxdist)</b></tt> Moves the instance
in the direction until a contact position with a solid object is
reached. If there is no collision at the current position, the
instance is placed just before a collision occurs. If there already
is a collision the instance is not moved. You can specify the
maximal distance to move (use a negative number for an arbitrary
distance).<br>
<tt><b>move_contact_all(dir,maxdist)</b></tt> Same as the previous
function but this time you stop at a contact with any object, not
just solid objects.<br>
<tt><b>move_outside_solid(dir,maxdist)</b></tt> Moves the instance
in the direction until it no longer lies within a solid object. If
there is no collision at the current position the instance is not
moved. You can specify the maximal distance to move (use a negative
number for an arbitrary distance).<br>
<tt><b>move_outside_all(dir,maxdist)</b></tt> Same as the previous
function but this time you move until outside any object, not just
solid objects.<br>
<tt><b>distance_to_point(x,y)</b></tt> Returns the distance of the
bounding box of the current instance to (x,y). (If the instance
does not have a sprite or mask, the result of the function is
undefined.)<br>
<tt><b>distance_to_object(obj)</b></tt> Returns the distance of the
instance to the nearest instance of object obj. (If the instance or
object does not have a sprite or mask, the result of the function
is undefined.)<br>
<tt><b>position_empty(x,y)</b></tt> Returns whether there is
nothing at position (x,y).<br>
<tt><b>position_meeting(x,y,obj)</b></tt> Returns whether at
position (x,y) there is an instance obj. obj can be an object, an
instance id, or the keywords <tt>self</tt>, <tt>other</tt>, or
<tt>all</tt>.<br></blockquote>
