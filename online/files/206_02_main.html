<h3>More main actions</h3>
Some additional main actions are available in advanced mode. The
following actions are added:

<p><b><img src="images/action_timeline_set.bmp"> Set Time
Line</b><br>
With this action you set the particular time line for an instance
of an object. You indicate the time line and the starting position
within the time line (0 is the beginning). Also you indicate
whether the time line should start immediately and whether it
should loop at the end.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_timeline_position.bmp"> Time Line
Position</b><br>
With this action you can change the position in the current time
line (either absolute or relative). This can be used to skip
certain parts of the time line or to repeat certain parts.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_timeline_speed.bmp"> Time Line
Speed</b><br>
With this action you can change the speed of the time line (either
absolute or relative). A speed of 1 is the normal speed. When you
e.g. set it to 2 the actions will happen twice as fast and when you
set it to 0.5 twice as slow. You can also set a negative speed, in
which case the time line is played backwards.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_timeline_start.bmp"> Start Time
Line</b><br>
This action starts the time line from its current position (if it
is paused or stopped).</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_timeline_pause.bmp"> Pause Time
Line</b><br>
This action pauses the time line. Use the start action to let it
continue.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_timeline_stop.bmp"> Stop Time
Line</b><br>
This action stops the time line and sets the position back to
0.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_splash_text.bmp"> Splash Text</b><br>
With this action you can show a text file. This can either be a
.txt file or a .rtf (Rich Text Format) file (no images or embedded
objects are shown though). You specify the file name. Make sure the
file exists. You should either distribute it with the game or
include it in the game through <b>Include Files</b> in the
<b>Resources</b> menu. (Note that no scrollbar will be shown nor is
there another way to scroll the text. So the text must fit the
window.) <b><i>This action is only available in the Standard
Edition.</i></b></p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_splash_image.bmp"> Splash
Image</b><br>
With this action you can show an image file. Most common image file
types are supported. You specify the file name. Make sure the file
exists. You should either distribute it with the game or include it
in the game through <b>Include Files</b> in the <b>Resources</b>
menu. You can e.g. use this to create a series of images as help
for your game. Not including the images in the game itself will
reduce game size and improve game loading time. <b><i>This action
is only available in the Standard Edition.</i></b></p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_splash_web.bmp"> Splash
Webpage</b><br>
With this action you can show a webpage. You provide the url and
whether it should be shown in the game window or in the default web
browser. The url can be the address of a website, for example
<tt>http://www.yoyogames.com</tt>) or can be the file name for a
local html file. Note however that you must provide the full path
for this to work (which is not the case for the other splash
actions). So you best use as url something like <tt>"" +
working_directory + "\index.html"</tt>. (The first two quotes are
required to indicate this is an expression rather than a string.)
You should either distribute the file with the game or include it
in the game through <b>Include Files</b> in the <b>Resources</b>
menu. You can e.g. use this to create fancy help pages for your
game. <b><i>This action is only available in the Standard
Edition.</i></b></p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_splash_video.bmp"> Splash
Video</b><br>
With this action you can show a video/movie file. You specify the
file name and whether is must be looped. Make sure the video file
exists. You should either distribute it with the game or include it
in the game through <b>Include Files</b> in the <b>Resources</b>
menu. <b><i>This action is only available in the Standard
Edition.</i></b></p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_splash_settings.bmp"> Splash
Settings</b><br>
With this action you can change certain settings for the splash
screens that you display with the previous actions. You can provide
the caption for the help window (only when it is shown in a
separate normal window), you can indicate where the splash screens
must be shown (inside the game window, in a normal window, or full
screen), you can indicate whether a close button must be shown in
the top right corner of the splash screen and whether pressing the
escape key or clicking with a mouse in the splash screen will close
the splash screen. (For web pages clicking with the mouse will not
work nor will the escape key work unless the close button is
shown.) <b><i>This action is only available in the Standard
Edition.</i></b></p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_resourcesprite.bmp"> Replace
Sprite</b><br>
This action can be used to replace a sprite from the contents of a
file. You indicate the sprite you want to replace, the filename and
the number of subimages in the sprite. Many different images file
formats are supported, e.g. .bmp, .jpg, .tif, and .gif. For a gif
file the number of subimages is automatically decided based on the
number of subimages in the gif file. Other settings for the sprite,
e.g. whether it is transparent or not, are not changed. You can use
this action to avoid storing all sprites in the program itself. For
example, at the beginning of a level you can replace sprites by the
actual character sprites you want to use. DON'T change a sprite
that is at that moment being used in an instance in the room. This
might give unwanted effects with collisions. <b><i>This action is
only available in the Standard Edition.</i></b></p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_resourcesound.bmp"> Replace
Sound</b><br>
With this action you can replace a sound by the contents of a file
(.wav, .mid, or .mp3). You specify the sound and the filename. This
avoids having to store all the sounds in the game itself. For
example, you can use different pieces of background music and pick
the one you want to play. DON'T change a sound while it is playing.
<b><i>This action is only available in the Standard
Edition.</i></b></p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_resourcebackground.bmp"> Replace
Background</b><br>
With this action you can replace a background by the contents of a
file. Many different images file formats are supported, e.g. .bmp,
.jpg, .tif, and .gif. You specify the background and the filename.
This avoids having to store all the backgrounds in the game itself.
DON'T change a background that is visible. <b><i>This action is
only available in the Standard Edition.</i></b></p>
