<h3>Advanced drawing functions</h3>
<i><b>This functionality is only available in the Standard Edition
of Game Maker.</b></i>
<p>Above, a number of basic drawing functions have been described.
Here you find a number of additional functions that offer you a lot
more possibilities. First of all there are functions to draw shapes
with gradient colors. Secondly there are functions to draw more
general polygons, and finally there is the possibility to draw
texture mapped polygons.</p>

<p>The following extended versions of the basic drawing functions
exist. each of them gets extra color parameters that are used the
determine the color at different vertices. The standard drawing
color is not used in these functions.</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>draw_point_color(x,y,col1)</b></tt> Draws a
point at (x,y) in the given color.<br>
<tt><b>draw_line_color(x1,y1,x2,y2,col1,col2)</b></tt> Draws a line
from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2), interpolating the color between col1 and
col2.<br>
<tt><b>draw_line_width_color(x1,y1,x2,y2,w,col1,col2)</b></tt>
Draws a line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) with width w interpolating the
color between col1 and col2.<br>
<tt><b>draw_rectangle_color(x1,y1,x2,y2,col1,col2,col3,col4,outline)</b></tt>
Draws a rectangle. The four colors indicated the colors at the
top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left vertex. outline
indicates whether only the outline must be drawn (true) or it
should be filled (false).<br>
<tt><b>draw_roundrect_color(x1,y1,x2,y2,col1,col2,outline)</b></tt>
Draws a rounded rectangle. col1 is the color in the middle and col2
the color at the boundary. outline indicates whether only the
outline must be drawn (true) or it should be filled (false).<br>
<tt><b>draw_triangle_color(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,col1,col2,col3,outline)</b></tt>
Draws a triangle. The three colors are the colors of the three
vertices which is interpolated over the triangle. outline indicates
whether only the outline must be drawn (true) or it should be
filled (false).<br>
<tt><b>draw_circle_color(x,y,r,col1,col2,outline)</b></tt> Draws a
circle at (x,y) with radius r. col1 is the color in the middle and
col2 the color at the boundary. outline indicates whether only the
outline must be drawn (true) or it should be filled (false).<br>
<tt><b>draw_ellipse_color(x1,y1,x2,y2,col1,col2,outline)</b></tt>
Draws an ellipse. col1 is the color in the middle and col2 the
color at the boundary. outline indicates whether only the outline
must be drawn (true) or it should be filled
(false).<br></blockquote>

<p>You can also draw larger primitives. This works slightly
different. You begin by specifying the primitive you want to draw.
Next you specify the vertices for it, and finally you end the
primitive, at which moment it is drawn. There are six types of
primitives:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>pr_pointlist</b></tt> The vertices are a set of
points.<br>
<tt><b>pr_linelist</b></tt> The vertices are a set of line
segments. Each pair of vertices forms a line segment. So there must
be an even set of vertices.<br>
<tt><b>pr_linestrip</b></tt> The vertices form a polyline with the
first connected to the second, the second to the third, etc. The
last one is not connected to the first one. You have to specify an
extra copy of the first vertex for this.<br>
<tt><b>pr_trianglelist</b></tt> The vertices are a set of
triangles. Each triple of vertices forms a triangle. So the number
of vertices must be a multiple of 3.<br>
<tt><b>pr_trianglestrip</b></tt> The vertices again form triangles
but this time it works slightly different. The first three form the
first triangle. The last two of these vertices, together with the
next vertex, form the second triangle, etc. So each new vertex
specifies a new triangle, connected to the previous one.<br>
<tt><b>pr_trianglefan</b></tt> Similar to a triangle list but this
time the first vertex is part of all the triangles. Again, each new
vertex specifies a new triangle, connected to the previous vertex
and the first vertex.<br></blockquote>

<p>The following functions exist for drawing primitives</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>draw_primitive_begin(kind)</b></tt> Start a
primitive of the indicated kind.<br>
<tt><b>draw_vertex(x,y)</b></tt> Add vertex (x,y) to the primitive,
using the color and alpha value set before.<br>
<tt><b>draw_vertex_color(x,y,col,alpha)</b></tt> Add vertex (x,y)
to the primitive, with its own color and alpha value. This allows
you to create primitives with smoothly changing color and alpha
values.<br>
<tt><b>draw_primitive_end()</b></tt> End the description of the
primitive. This function actually draws it.<br></blockquote>

<p>Finally, it is possible to draw primitives using sprites or
backgrounds as textures. When using a texture the image is placed
on the primitive, reshaping it to fit the primitive. Textures are
used to add detail to primitives, e.g. a brick wall. To use
textures you first must obtain the id of the texture you want to
use. For this the following functions exist:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>sprite_get_texture(spr,subimg)</b></tt> Returns
the id of the texture corresponding to subimage subimg of the
indicated sprite.<br>
<tt><b>background_get_texture(back)</b></tt> Returns the id of the
texture corresponding to the indicated background.<br></blockquote>

<p>A selected texture might not yet be in video memory. The system
will put it there once you need it but sometimes you want to decide
this yourself. For this the following two functions exist:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>texture_preload(texid)</b></tt> Puts the texture
immediately into video memory.<br>
<tt><b>texture_set_priority(texid,prio)</b></tt> When there is too
little video memory some will be removed temporarily to make room
for others that are needed. The ones with lowest priority are
removed first. Default, all have priority 0 but you can change the
priority here. (Use positive values!)<br></blockquote>

<p>To add textures to primitives you must specify which parts of
the textures must be put where on the primitive. Positions in the
texture are indicated with values between 0 and 1 but there is a
problem here. Sizes of textures must be powers of 2 (so e.g. 32x32
or 64x64). If you want to use sprites or background as textures you
better make sure they have such a size. If not, the test will be
blank. To find out which part of the texture is actually used you
can use the following two functions. They return a value between 0
and 1 that indicates the width or height of the actual part of the
texture being used. Specifying this value as texture coordinate
will indicate the right or bottom side of the texture.</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>texture_get_width(texid)</b></tt> Returns the
width of the texture with the given id. The width lies in the range
0-1.<br>
<tt><b>texture_get_height(texid)</b></tt> Returns the height of the
texture with the given id. The height lies in the range
0-1.<br></blockquote>

<p>To draw textured primitives you use the following functions:</p>

<blockquote>
<tt><b>draw_primitive_begin_texture(kind,texid)</b></tt> Start a
primitive of the indicated kind with the given texture.<br>
<tt><b>draw_vertex_texture(x,y,xtex,ytex)</b></tt> Add vertex (x,y)
to the primitive with position (xtex,ytex) in the texture, blending
with the color and alpha value set before. xtex and ytex should
normally lie between 0 and 1 but also larger values can be used,
leading to a repetition of the texture (see below).<br>
<tt><b>draw_vertex_texture_color(x,y,xtex,ytex,col,alpha)</b></tt>
Add vertex (x,y) to the primitive with position (xtex,ytex) in the
texture, blending with its own color and alpha value.<br>
<tt><b>draw_primitive_end()</b></tt> End the description of the
primitive. This function actually draws it.<br></blockquote>

<p>There are three functions that influence how textures are
drawn:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>texture_set_interpolation(linear)</b></tt>
Indicates whether to use linear interpolation (true) or pick the
nearest pixel (false). Linear interpolation gives smoother textures
but can also be a bit blurry and sometimes costs extra time. This
setting also influence the drawing of sprites and background.
Default is false. (This can also be changed in the global game
settings.)<br>
<tt><b>texture_set_blending(blend)</b></tt> Indicates whether to
use blending with colors and alpha values. Switching this off might
be faster on old hardware. This setting also influence the drawing
of sprites and background. Default is true.<br>
<tt><b>texture_set_repeat(repeat)</b></tt> Indicates whether to use
repeat the texture. This works as follows. As indicated above
texture coordinates lie in the range 0-1. If you specify a value
larger than 1, default the rest is not drawn. By setting repeat to
true the texture is repeated. Note that sprites and backgrounds are
always drawn without repeating. So once you draw a sprite of
background this value is reset to false. Default is
false.<br></blockquote>

<p>There are two more function that are not only useful for drawing
textures. Normally primitives are blended with the background using
the alpha value. You can actually indicate how this must happen.
Besides the normal mode it is possible to indicate that the new
color must be added to the existing color or subtracted from the
existing color. This can be used to create e.g. spot lights or
shadows. Also it is possible to sort of take the maximum of the new
and existing color. This can avoid certain saturation effects that
you can get with adding. Note that both subtracting and maximum do
not take the alpha value fully into account. (DirectX does not
allow this.) So you better make sure the outside area is black.
There are two functions. The first one only gives you the four
options described above. The second function gives you a lot more
possibilities. You should experiment a bit with the settings. If
used effectively they can be used to create e.g. interesting
explosion or halo effects.</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>draw_set_blend_mode(mode)</b></tt> Indicates
what blend mode to use. The following values are possible:
<tt>bm_normal</tt>, <tt>bm_add</tt>, <tt>bm_subtract</tt>, and
<tt>bm_max</tt>. Don't forget to reset the mode to normal after use
because otherwise also other sprites and even the backgrounds are
drawn with the new blend mode.<br>
<tt><b>draw_set_blend_mode_ext(src,dest)</b></tt> Indicates what
blend mode to use for both the source and destination color. The
new color is some factor times the source and another factor times
the destination. These factors are set with this function. To
understand this, the source and destination both have a red, green,
blue, and alpha component. So the source is (Rs, Gs, Bs, As) and
the destination is (Rd, Gd, Bd, Ad). All are considered to lie
between 0 and 1. The blend factors you can choose for source and
destination are:

<ul>
<li>bm_zero: Blend factor is (0, 0, 0, 0).</li>

<li>bm_one: Blend factor is (1, 1, 1, 1).</li>

<li>bm_src_color: Blend factor is (Rs, Gs, Bs, As).</li>

<li>bm_inv_src_color: Blend factor is (1–Rs, 1–Gs, 1–Bs,
1–As).</li>

<li>bm_src_alpha: Blend factor is (As, As, As, As).</li>

<li>bm_inv_src_alpha: Blend factor is (1–As, 1–As, 1–As,
1–As).</li>

<li>bm_dest_alpha: Blend factor is (Ad, Ad, Ad, Ad).</li>

<li>bm_inv_dest_alpha: Blend factor is (1–Ad, 1–Ad, 1–Ad,
1–Ad).</li>

<li>bm_dest_color: Blend factor is (Rd, Gd, Bd, Ad).</li>

<li>bm_inv_dest_color: Blend factor is (1–Rd, 1–Gd, 1–Bd,
1–Ad).</li>

<li>bm_src_alpha_sat: Blend factor is (f, f, f, 1); f = min(As,
1–Ad).</li>
</ul>
For example, the normal blending mode sets the source blending to
bm_src_alpha and the destination blending to bm_inv_src_alpha.
Don't forget to reset the mode to normal after use because
otherwise also other sprites and even the backgrounds are drawn
with the new blend mode.<br></blockquote>

<p>Drawing texture primitives is a bit of work but can lead to
great results. You can even use it to make fake 3D games.</p>
