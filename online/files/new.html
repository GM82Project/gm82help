<h1>What is New in Version 8.0</h1>

<p>Version 8.0 of <i>Game Maker</i> has a large number of
improvements over version 7.0. Below the most important changes are
described.</p>

<h3>Incompatibilities</h3>

<p>Text splash screens can no longer show images. However, web
splash screens have been added that can show full html documents
with images, etc.</p>

<p>A number of changes have been made to the functions related to
sprite and background resources. This is due to the fact that
<i>Game Maker</i> uses a completely new mechanism for these
resources. If your game uses a lot of calls to functions that load
or save image resources on the fly you are strongly recommended to
keep using the old version 7.0 for that game.</p>

<p>If you use extension packages you will have to reinstall
them.</p>

<p>Some changes have been made to the timeline mechanism that can
lead to incompatibilities. In particular, assigning a timeline and
starting it are now two separate things.</p>

<p>An important bug has been solved in which collision events where
executed twice if two objects have collision events with each
other. Some games however might have relied on this bug and, hence,
might no longer function correctly.</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p><i>Game Maker</i> now default shows a News page when it is
started. Here new versions will be announced, new resources will be
indicated, there is information about competition, and game design
tips and tricks. News is shown only once a day. In the Standard
Edition this can be switched off. You can always access the news
through the Help menu and you are encouraged to regularly check the
news for important information about <i>Game Maker</i>.</p>

<h3>Tutorial</h3>

<p><i>Game Maker</i> now has a standard built-in tutorial for
beginners. It is shown in a panel at the right of the screen.
Experienced users can indicate that they do not want to see the
tutorial anymore. To accommodate for the tutorial panel, <i>Game
Maker</i> is now default started in full screen mode. It does
however remember its settings so changing it once to windowed mode
will from that moment on start it in that mode.</p>

<h3>Alpha-blended backgrounds and sprites</h3>

<p>The new version <i>Game Maker</i> uses backgrounds and sprites
with alpha (transparency) channels. This makes it possible to
create and use much nicer sprites. PNG files with such information
are now correctly loaded. The sprite and image editor have been
completely rewritten, including many new drawing options and
effects. A new sprite file selector was added that shows the
animations in the sprites. Also we bundle a large number of
high-quality sprites with <i>Game Maker</i> that you can use for
free in your games.</p>

<h3>Enhanced collision checking</h3>

<p>You now have more collision checking options. For example, you
can indicate that collisions should be with an enclosed disk and
you have better control over the bounding box. The sub-image of the
sprite can have a combined mask and you can set the dependence on
the alpha transparency value.</p>

<h3>Splash screens</h3>

<p>A new function splash_show_web(url,delay) has been added that
can be used to show web pages as splash screens. You can also use
local html pages for this. This allows for a powerful mechanism to
e.g. create help pages. A close button is added to the splash
screens. Also a number of new actions have been added to show the
different types of splash pages and to change splash settings. (The
old Show Video and Webpage actions have been removes as the new
actions include them. They will though still work in old
games.)</p>

<h3>Trigger events</h3>

<p>A new type of event has been introduced: Trigger events. Trigger
events you can specify yourself. You give them a name and a
condition, written in GML. After this they can be used in all
objects, just like other events. With this you can easily extend
the functionality of <i>Game Maker</i>.</p>

<h3>Time lines</h3>

<p>The timelines have been extended. The property form has
additional buttons to e.g. spread out the moments and to delete or
duplicate ranges of moments. Timelines can now be paused and
restarted and they can even be played backwards. Also they can now
loop automatically.</p>

<h3>Importing and exporting resources</h3>

<p>The possibility to merge games has been replaced by a much more
extensive system to import and export resources. The user can
indicate which resources to export to a file (.gmres). Next they
can be imported in a different game. In principle only one resource
can exist for each name. When there is a name conflict when
importing the use can specify to keep the original, replace anyway,
take the one that is most recently changed, or keep both (not
recommended). To be able to do the third option, all resources now
keep track of when they were last changed.</p>

<h3>Rewritten script and code editor</h3>

<p>The built-in script/code editor has been completely rewritten,
making it a lot easier to write code. For example there is pop-up
function name completion, argument help, matching brackets,
improved color coding, line numbers, on-the-fly error checking,
code snippets, and a sophisticated find and replace
functionality.</p>

<h3>Speed improvements</h3>

<p>The speed of games that use code has been considerably improved.
A speed-up of up to 100% is sometimes possible. Also the loading
time for games is often considerably improved. Also when running a
stand-alone game.</p>

<h3>Other changes</h3>

<p>There are a number of other changes and additions. Here are some
of the important ones.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can now use high quality icons for your games.</li>

<li>Constants can now be defined in their own form (rather than
through the Global Game Settings). As a result they can remain
visible while you are e.g. writing scripts. You can also load and
save the constants to text files.</li>

<li>Also included files are no longer shown in the Global Game
Settings but in their own form.</li>

<li>Many small visual improvements</li>

<li>Added function random_range(x1,x2), irandom(x), and
irandom_range(x1,x2). The latter do give integer results and can
include x or x2.</li>

<li>Added functions mouse_wheel_up and mouse_wheel_down.</li>

<li>Added a function set_application_title(title) to set the title
of the application (which is shown in the taskbar).</li>

<li>Added function file_text_eoln().</li>

<li>Added read-only variabe debug_mode.</li>

<li>There is now a game setting to disallow screensavers or
powersaving options (sleep, hybernate) while the game is running
(default disallowed).</li>

<li>Added functions disk_size(drive) and disk_free(drive) and a
variable gamemaker_version.</li>

<li>Runtime error messages better indicate the position of the
error</li>

<li>You can now change to location of the temporary files, see the
page on Preferences.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Corrected bugs</h3>

<p>The following bugs were corrected. A number of other smaller
bugs were corrected as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>An error message when starting the Maker on Vista with Active
User Control is now removed.</li>

<li>Corrected a bug that when using Alt many fields in forms became
invisible under Vista.</li>

<li>Corrected a bug with action hints not showing in the object and

code editor.</li>

<li>Creating a standalone now correctly checks whether there are
any rooms.</li>

<li>Replaced all Ctrl+Alt combinatations by Shift+Ctrl because some
of combinations are important for German keyboards. Also corrected
the shortcut for creating sprites.</li>

<li>In simple modes, short-cuts for hidden resources and menu items
now are disabled as well. Also the Scripts menu is hidden.</li>

rooms and instances in rooms.</li>

<li>room_tile_add and room_tile_add_ext now correctly set the
blending color to white and return the correct tile index.</li>

<li>Now correctly setting the application title to the file

twice if two objects have collision events with each other.</li>

<li>Solved a bug in draw_text_ext with empty lines (multiple #) and
a problem with drawing strings that contains CR-LF pairs (when
using multiline strings in code).</li>

<li>Read-only files can now be used as included files without
errors.</li>
</ul>
