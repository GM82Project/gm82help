<h1>3D Graphics</h1>
<i><b>This functionality is only available in the Standard Edition
of Game Maker.</b></i>
<p><i>Game Maker</i> is a program meant for making 2-dimensional
and isometric games. Still there is some functionality to create
3-dimensional graphics. Before you start with this though there are
a few things you must understand.</p>

<ul>
<li>The 3D functionality in <i>Game Maker</i> is limited to the
graphics part. There is no support for other 3D functionality. Once
you start using 3D graphics you might get problems with other
aspects of <i>Game Maker</i>, like the views, depth ordering, etc.
The functionality is limited and has low priority to be extended.
So don't expect support for 3D object models, etc.</li>

<li>When you use the 3D functionality, there are a number of other
things that can no longer be used.

<ul>
<li>You cannot use background and foregrounds in your rooms
anymore. (The reason is that they are tiled to fill the image but
with perspective projections this no longer work correctly).</li>

<li>You cannot use the mouse position anymore. The mouse will not
be transformed to the 3D coordinates. You can still get the
position of the mouse on the screen (in the view) but you will have
to do calculation with this yourself (or not use the mouse at
all).</li>

<li>You cannot use tiles anymore. Tiles will most likely no longer
match up correctly.</li>

<li>Collision checking still uses the 2-d positions of the
instances in the room. So there is no collision detection in 3D.
Sometimes you can still use this (if you use the room as a
representation of a flat world (e.g. for racing or FPS games) but
in other situations you have to do things yourself.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>All 3D functionality is through code. You must be rather fluent
with the GML language. Also you must really understand a lot about
how <i>Game Maker</i> works otherwise you will run into
trouble.</li>

<li>You must have some basic knowledge about 3D graphics. In
particular I will use terms like perspective projections, hidden
surface removal, lighting, and fog, without much explanation.</li>

<li>There is no 3D modelling in <i>Game Maker</i>. Also I do not
plan on adding support for loading 3D models.</li>

<li>You must work carefully to keep a reasonable speed. Also,
things are not really optimized for speed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this did not discourage you, read on.</p>
