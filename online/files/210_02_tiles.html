<h3>Adding tiles</h3>
You can also create so-called tiled background. The idea behind
this is as follows: In many games you will want to have nice
looking backgrounds. For example, in a maze game, the walls of the
maze should nicely match up, and in platform games you like to see
beautifully drawn platforms, trees, etc. You can do this in <i>Game
Maker</i> by defining many different objects and composing your
rooms from these objects. The problem though is that this takes a
lot of work, uses large amounts of resources, and makes the games
run slowly because of the many different objects. For example, to
create nice walls in maze games you need as a start 15 differently
shaped wall objects.

<p>The standard way out, used in many games, is that the walls and
other static objects are actually drawn on the background. But, you
might ask, how does the game know that an object hits a wall if it
is drawn on the background only? The trick is as follows: You
create just one wall object in your game. It must have the right
size but it does not need to look nice. When creating the room,
place this object at all places where there is a wall. And, here
comes the trick, we make this object invisible. So when playing the
game you don't see the wall objects. You see the beautiful
background instead. But the solid wall objects are still there and
the instances in the game will react to them.</p>

<p>You can use this technique for any object that is not changing
its shape or position. (You cannot use it when the object must be
animated.) For platform games, you probably need just one floor and
one wall object, but you can make beautifully looking backgrounds
where it looks as if you walk on grass, on tree branches, etc.</p>

<p>To add tiles to your room you first need to add a background
resource to your game that contains the tiles. If you want to have
your tiles partially transparent, make sure you make the background
image transparent when loading it. When adding the background
resource indicate that it must be used as a tile set. Next indicate
the size of each tile and whether there is room between the tiles,
as was indicated in the chapter on background resources.</p>

<p>Now, when defining your room, click on the tab <b>tiles</b>. The
following form is shown (actually, we already added some tiles in
this room and switched off the grid).</p>

<p><img src="images/form_room_tiles.jpg">
</p>

<p>At the left top there is the current set of tiles used. To
select the set, click on the menu button below it and select the
appropriate background image.</p>

<p>Now you can add tiles by selecting the tile you want at the top
left, and next clicking at the appropriate place in the room at the
right. This works in exactly the same way as for adding instances.
Underlying tiles are removed, unless you uncheck the box <b>Delete
underlying</b>. You can use the right button to delete tiles. Hold
the &lt;Shift&gt; key to add multiple tiles. And hold the
&lt;Ctrl&gt; key to move tiles to a new place. The &lt;Alt&gt; key
will avoid snapping to the gird. Also there is again a pop- up menu
when you hold the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key and click on a tile with the
right mouse button. The buttons in the toolbar will now clear all
tiles, shift all tiles, sort the tiles or lock/unlock them.
(Actually they only operate on the current layer; see below.)</p>

<p>In some situations you might want to put a part of the
background in the room that is not exactly the size of a tile or
consists of multiple tiles. This can be done as follows. In the
top-left image press the left mouse button while holding the
&lt;Alt&gt; key. Now you can drag an area which you can then place
in the room in the same way as tiles. To select multiple tiles,
hold the &lt;Shift&gt; key. Note that this only works correctly
when there is no separation between the tiles. If you want to
select an area that is multiple of the room grid size, hold the
&lt;Ctrl&gt; key rather than the &lt;Shift&gt; key. (Note that you
can actually change the key you hold during the dragging. This can
sometimes be useful.)</p>

<p>Tiles can be placed in layers at different depths. At the bottom
you see the current depth. Default this is 1000000 which is
normally behind all instances. So the instances will move in front
of the tiles. You can use the <b>Add</b> button to add new tile
layers, each with a different depth. Negative depths can be used to
put tiles in front of instances. If you also give objects different
depths you can put them between different tile layers. If you press
<b>Delete</b> you delete a tile layer together with all its tiles.
(There must always be at least one layer.) If you press
<b>Change</b> you can change the depth of a tile layer. If you give
it the same depth as another layer, the layers are merged.</p>

<p>Using tiles is a powerful feature that should be used as much as
possible. It is much faster than using objects and the tile images
are stored only once. So you can use large tiled rooms with very
little memory consumption.</p>
