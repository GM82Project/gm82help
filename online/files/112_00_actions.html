<h1>Actions</h1>
Actions indicate the things that happen in a game created with
<i>Game Maker</i>. Actions are placed in events of objects.
Whenever the event takes place these actions are performed,
resulting in certain behavior for the instances of the object.
There are a large number of different actions available and it is
important that you understand what they do. In this chapter we
describe the actions available in simple mode. Note that a number
of these actions are only available in the Standard Edition of
<i>Game Maker</i>. This will be indicated.

<p>All the actions are found in the tabbed pages at the right of
the object property form. There are six sets of actions. You select
the set you want by clicking on the correct tab. When you hold you
mouse above one of the actions, a short description is shown to
remind you of its function.</p>

<p>Let us briefly repeat: To put an action in an event, just drag
it from the tabbed pages to the action list. You can change the
order in the list, again using dragging. Holding the &lt;Alt&gt;
key while dragging makes a copy of the action. (You can drag and
copy actions between the lists in different object property forms.)
Use the right mouse button and select the correct menu item to
remove actions (or use the &lt;Del&gt; key) and to copy and paste
selected actions.</p>

<p>When you drop an action in the action list, a window will pop-up
most of the time, in which you can fill in certain parameters for
the action. The parameters will be described below when describing
the actions. Two types of parameters appear in many actions so we
will describe these here. At the top you can indicate to which
instance the action applies. The default is <tt>self</tt>, which is
the instance for which the action is performed. Most of the time,
this is what you want. In the case of a collision event, you can
also specify to apply the action to the other instance involved in
the collision. For instance, in this way you can destroy the other
instance. Finally, you can choose to apply the action to all
instances of a particular object. In this way you could change all
red balls into blue balls. The second type of parameter is the box
labeled <b>Relative</b>. By checking this box, the values you type
in are relative to the current values. For example, in this way you
can add something to the current score, rather than changing the
current score to the new value. The other parameters will be
described below. You can later change the parameters by double
clicking on the action.</p>

<p>Information on the different actions can be found in the
following pages:</p>
