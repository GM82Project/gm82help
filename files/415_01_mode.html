<h3>Going to 3D mode</h3>

If you want to use 3D mode you first need to set <i>GameMaker</i> in 3D mode. You can later
switch back to 2D mode if you want. The following two functions exist for this.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>d3d_start()</b></tt>
    Start using 3D mode. Returns whether successful.<br>
  <tt><b>d3d_end()</b></tt>
    Stop using 3D mode. Returns whether successful.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that all functions related to 3D mode start with <tt>d3d_</tt>. 

<p>
Starting 3D mode will result in the following changes. First of all depth testing 
    (also known as Z Buffering) is switched on (using a 24-bit z-buffer). This means that for each pixel on the screen
only the drawing with the smallest z-value (= depth value) is drawn. If instances have the
same depth then you will get what is known as Z-fighting. This occurs as the 2 
    instances attempt to draw at the same level, and inaccuracys in the rendering 
    due to very close Z value cause ugly effects. To avoid this, try and make sure instances
that might overlap do not have the same depth value!

<p>
Secondly, the normal orthographic projection is replaced by a perspective one. This means the
following. Normally the size of instances on the screen is independent on its depth. With a
perspective projection instances that have a greater depth will appear smaller. When the depth
is 0 it is equal to the old size (unless you change the projection; see below). The viewpoint
for the camera is placed at a distance above the room. (This distance is equal to the width
of the room; that gives a reasonable default projection.) Only instances in front of the camera
are drawn. So don't use instances with a depth smaller than 0 (or at least not smaller than -w
where w is the width of the room or the view).

<p>
Thirdly, the vertical y-coordinate is reversed. While normally the (0,0) position is at the top-left
of the view, in 3D mode the (0,0) position is at the bottom-left position, as is normal for 
3-dimensional views.

<p>
You can actually switch hidden surface remove and perspective projection on or off using the
following functions. 
	
<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>d3d_set_hidden(enable)</b></tt> Enables (true) or disables (false) depth 
    testing.<br>
  <tt><b>d3d_set_perspective(enable)</b></tt>
    Enables the use of a perspective projection (true) or disables it (false).<br>
</blockquote>
