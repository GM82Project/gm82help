<h1>Upgrading to the Standard Edition</h1>

<i>GameMaker</i> comes in two editions, the Lite Edition and Standard Edition.

<p>
The <b>Lite Edition</b> is meant for those that take their first steps on the
path of developing games. It can be used for free but is limited in its
functionality. Also it shows a popup logo when running games and will regularly
remind you of upgrading the program. When you are using <i>GameMaker</i> regularly
you are strongly recommended to upgrade from the Lite Edition.

      while the game is running.</li>

  <li>You get the possibility to include additional files in the game executables 
      that can be used when the game is run.</li>
  <li>Standard Edition can be easily extended using extension package. These can be made by
      everybody and will in general be provided free of charge.</li>
  <li>Three such extension packages are included adding many room transitions, windows 
      dialogs, and printing facilities.</li>

Upgrading from Lite Edition costs only $39.99 (subject to change). This is a one-time fee that will be valid
for all versions 8.x of <i>GameMaker</i>.

<p>
    When you are running the Lite Edition, you can upgrade to Standard by 
    using the welcoming screen when you open GameMaker. <br />
        To upgrade 
    from the e Welcome</b> screen, simply click the <b>Purchase Now!</b> button, then 
    proceed through the purchase process. Once you have completed purchase, you will 
    be shown your new license which you can copy and paste into the text box in Step 2, and click the <b>Upgrade Now!</b> button. GameMaker 
    will then upgrade to the full Standard Edition.<br />
    <br />
    The license file will also be emailed to you using the email address you type in 
    during purchase, and if you&#39;ve logged into YoYo Games store, it will also be 
    tied to that account, allowing you to retrieve it at any time. If you don&#39;t 
    login, the email will also contain details of a new account setup using the 
    email address you provided. This will again let you retrieve your GameMaker 
    License code.<br />
    <br />

    Games website, and point the auto update system to it. if you fail to provide a 
    valid file, or an internet connection when requested, your copy of <i>GameMaker</i> will be 
    downgraded to Lite until such time as you do.</p>
