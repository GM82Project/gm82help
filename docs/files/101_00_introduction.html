<h1>So you want to create your own computer games</h1>

<p>Playing computer games is fun. But it is actually more fun to
design your own computer games and let other people play them. In
the past, creating computer games was not easy. Commercial computer
games you buy nowadays typically take one or two years of
development with teams of anywhere between 10 and 50 people.
Budgets easily reach millions of dollars. And all these people are
highly experienced: programmers, art designers, sound technicians,
etc.</p>

<p>But <i>Game Maker</i> has changed this. With <i>Game Maker</i>
you can create your own computer games quickly without the need to
learn a programming language. Of course you should not expect to
create your own <i>Halo 4</i> or <i>Virtua Tennis</i> within a few
weeks. But that is also not necessary. The joy of playing a game is
not related to its complexity. Simpler games, like <i>Tetris</i>,
<i>Bejeweled</i>, <i>Space Invaders</i>, etc. are a lot of fun to
play and a lot easier to create.</p>

<p><i>Game Maker</i> offers an intuitive and easy to use
drag-and-drop interface that allows you to create your own games
very quickly. You can import and create images, sprites (animated
images) and sounds and use them. <i>Game Maker</i> is bundled with
a considerable collection of such resources to get you started. You
can easily define the objects in your game and indicate their
behavior, and you can define appealing rooms (levels) in which the
game takes place. And if you want full control there is actually an
easy-to-use programming language built into <i>Game Maker</i> that
gives you full control over what is happening in your game.</p>

<p><i>Game Maker</i> focuses on two-dimensional games. So it is not
meant to create 3D worlds like <i>Quake</i>, even though there is
some limited functionality for 3D graphics. But donâ€™t let this put
you down. Many great games use two-dimensional sprite technology,
even though they look very 3-dimensional. And designing
two-dimensional games is a lot easier and faster.</p>

<p><i>Game Maker</i> currently comes in two editions, the Lite
Edition and Standard Edition. The Lite Edition can be used free of
charge but it is limited in its functionality and will display
popup messages. You can though freely distribute the games you
create with it; you can even sell them if you like. See the
enclosed license agreement for more details. You are strongly
encouraged to upgrade your copy of <i>Game Maker</i> from the Lite
Edition. It will considerably extend the functionality of <i>Game
Maker</i> and it will remove the logo when running games. This will
also support the further development of <i>Game Maker</i>. For more
information on upgrading see the <a href="103_00_pro.html">Standard
Edition</a> page.</p>

<p>This help file will tell you the most important things you need
to know about <i>Game Maker</i> and how you can create your own
games with it. Please realize that, even with a program like
<i>Game Maker</i>, designing computer games is not completely
effortless. There are too many aspects that are important: game
play, graphics, sounds, user interaction, etc. Start with easy
examples and you will realize that creating games is great fun.
Also check the web site</p>

<p>for lots of examples, tutorials, ideas, and links to other sites
and forums. And soon you will become a master game maker yourself.
Enjoy.</p>
