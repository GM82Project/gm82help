<h3>Setting up a connection</h3>
For two computer to communicate they will need some connection
protocol. Like most games, <i>Game Maker</i> offers four different
types of connections: IPX, TCP/IP, Modem, and Serial. The IPX
connection (to be more precise, it is a protocol) is almost
completely transparent. It can be used to play games with other
people on the same local area network. It needs to be installed on
your computer to be used. (If it does not work, consult the
documentation of Windows. Or go to the Network item in the control
panel of Windows and add the IPX protocol.) TCP/IP is the internet
protocol. It can be used to play with other players anywhere on the
internet, assuming you know their IP address. On a local network
you can use it without providing addresses. A modem connection is
made through the modem. You have to provide some modem settings (an
initialization string and a phone number) to use it. Finally, when
using a serial line (a direct connection between the computers) you
need to provide a number of port settings. There are four GML
functions that can be used for initializing these connections:

<blockquote><tt><b>mplay_init_ipx()</b></tt> initializes an IPX
connection.<br>
<tt><b>mplay_init_tcpip(addr)</b></tt> initializes a TCP/IP
connection. addr is a string containing the web address or IP
address, e.g. 'www.gameplay.com' or '123.123.123.12', possibly
followed by a port number (e.g. ':12'). Only when joining a session
(see below) do you need to provide an address. On a local area
network no addresses are necessary.<br>
<tt><b>mplay_init_modem(initstr,phonenr)</b></tt> initializes a
modem connection. initstr is the initialization string for the
modem (can be empty). phonenr is a string that contains the phone
number to ring (e.g. '0201234567'). Only when joining a session
(see below) do you need to provide a phone number.<br>
<tt><b>mplay_init_serial(portno,baudrate,stopbits,parity,flow)</b></tt>
initializes a serial connection. portno is the port number (1-4).
baudrate is the baudrate to be used (100-256K). stopbits indicates
the number of stopbits (0 = 1 bit, 1 = 1.5 bit, 2 = 2 bits). parity
indicates the parity (0=none, 1=odd, 2=even, 3=mark). And flow
indicates the type of flow control (0=none, 1=xon/xoff, 2=rts,
3=dtr, 4=rts and dtr). Returns whether successful. A typical call
is mplay_init_serial(1,57600,0,0,4). Give 0 as a first argument to
open a dialog for the user to change the settings.<br></blockquote>

<p>Your game should call one of these functions exactly once. All
functions report whether they were successful. They are not
successful if the particular protocol is not installed or supported
by your machine. To check whether there is a successful connection
available you can use the following function</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>mplay_connect_status()</b></tt> returns the
status of the current connection. 0 = no connection, 1 = IPX
connection, 2 = TCP/IP connection, 3 = modem connection, and 4 =
serial connection.<br></blockquote>

<p>To end the connection call</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>mplay_end()</b></tt> ends the current
connection.<br></blockquote>

<p>When using a TCP/IP connection you might want to tell the person
you want to play the game with what the ip address of your computer
is. The following function helps you here:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>mplay_ipaddress()</b></tt> returns the IP
address of your machine (e.g. '123.123.123.12') as a string. You
can e.g. display this somewhere on the screen. Note that this
routine is slow so don't call it all the time.<br></blockquote>
