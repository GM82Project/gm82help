<h3>Including files in stand-alone games</h3>
<b><i>This functionality is only available in the Standard Edition
of Game Maker.</i></b>
<p>As has been indicated before, you can create stand-alone
versions of your game. Sometimes your game will use additional
files. For example you might want to include video files or text
files that are used in the game. In some cases you want to add DLLs
or images and sounds that are loaded during the running of the
game. You can provide these together with the stand-alone
executable but it is sometimes easier to include them in the file.
In this way only one file needs to be distributed. Included files
will default be exported when the game starts.</p>

<p>You can indicate the files you want to include in the executable
in by choosing <b>Included Files</b> from the <b>Resources</b>
menu. The following form will be shown:</p>

<p><img src="images/form_include.jpg">
</p>

<p>At the top of the form is a list of files to include. Use
<b>Add</b> to add a new file to the list, <b>Change</b> to change a
selected file, <b>Delete</b> to delete the selected file, and
<b>Clear</b> to clear the complete list. When adding or changing an
entry, the following form will pop up:</p>

<p><img src="images/form_datafile.jpg">
</p>

<p>Here you can indicate a number of properties. You can press the
<b>Load</b> button to indicate which file must be included. You can
change the <b>File Name</b> if you want to save the file under a
different name than the original file name.</p>

<p>There are a number of options you can set. When you check
<b>Store in the editable .gm81 file</b> the included file in not
only added to the executable but also to the editable version of
the game. The advantage is that you can e.g. send the editable
version to somebody else and can be sure the file is still there.
Also, you can remove the included file if you want or move it
elsewhere without problems. The disadvantage is that the editable
version of the game becomes larger and takes longer to load.</p>

<p>Checking the option <b>Free memory after export</b> means that
after the file has been exported (when running the game) it will be
removed from memory. If you want to be able to export it again
later you should uncheck this option. If a file that is exported
already exists it is normally not written. You can change this
behavior by checking <b>Overwrite existing files</b>. Also, when
the game is finished the files are normally not removed (unless
they are in the temporary folder which is completely removed). You
can change this by checking <b>Remove at game end</b>.</p>

<p><b>A word of warning is in place here. If you are testing your
game, the working directory of the game is the directory where the
.gm81 file is stored. If your include files are also stored here
and you choose to remove them at the end of the game you might
loose them alltogether! So better not store these files with the
.gm81 file but e.g. in a subfolder!</b>
</p>

<p>Finally you can indicate to what folder the files are exported.
There are four options here. In the default situation the files are
exported in the folder where the stand-alone game is stored. This
is also the working directory for the game. So the game can just
use the file names to access them (no paths are required). This
works well if the stand-alone is stored e.g. on the hard disk but
will fail if it is stored on a read-only device, e.g. on a CD.</p>

<p>The second possibility is to indicate that the files must be
exported into the temporary folder that is created during the
running of the game. If you select this option you will need to
provide the path to the temporary folder when you use the file name
during the game. This path can be obtained using the built-in
variable <tt>temp_directory</tt>. Don't forget to add the backslash
in this case. So to e.g. play a video file you might type in the
following piece of code:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  splash_show_video(temp_directory+'\movie.avi',<b>true</b>);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Realize that this temporary folder is removed once the game is
finished. So you e.g. cannot store save games or special
information in this case. Only choose this option when you want the
game to be run from a CD or when you do not write any files from
within your game.</p>

<p>The third option is to indicate the folder to which the file
must be exported yourself. If it does not exist it will be created.
E.g. you could specify <tt>C:\MyGame</tt>. (Note that you need to
provide a full patgh and that you should not include a backslash at
the end.) This is only allowed when the game does not run in secure
mode.</p>

<p>Finally, you can indicate not the export the file automatically.
In this case you should use e.g. the function
<tt>export_include_file(fname)</tt> to export it yourself when
required.</p>
