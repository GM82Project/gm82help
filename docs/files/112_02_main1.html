<h3>Main actions, set 1</h3>
The following set of actions deals with creating, changing, and
destroying instances of objects, with sounds, and with rooms.

<p><b><img src="images/action_create.bmp"> Create Instance</b><br>
With this action you can create an instance of an object. You
specify which object to create and the position for the new
instance. If you check the <b>Relative</b> box, the position is
relative to the position of the current instance. Creating
instances during the game is extremely useful. A space ship can
create bullets; a bomb can create an explosion, etc. In many games
you will have some controller object that from time to time creates
monsters or other objects. For the newly created instance the
creation event is executed.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_createspeed.bmp"> Create
Moving</b><br>
This action works the same as the action above but with two
additional fields. You can now also specify the speed and direction
of the newly created instance. Note that if you check the
<b>Relative</b> box, only the position is relative, not the speed
and direction. For example, to make a bullet move in the direction
of the person shooting you have to use a little trick. As position
use 0,0 and check <b>Relative</b>. As direction we need the current
direction of the instance. This can be obtained by typing in the
word <tt>direction</tt>. (This actually is a variable that always
indicates the current direction in which the instance is
moving.)</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_createrandom.bmp"> Create
Random</b><br>
This action lets you create an instance of one out of four objects.
You specify the four objects and the position. An instance of one
of these four objects is created at the given position. If you
check the <b>Relative</b> box, the position is relative to the
position of the current instance. If you need a choice out of less
than four objects you can use No Object for some of them. This is
for example useful to generate a random enemy at a location.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_change.bmp"> Change Instance</b><br>
With this action you can change the current instance into an
instance of another object. So for example, you can change an
instance of a bomb into an explosion. All settings, such as the
motion and the value of variables, will stay the same. You can
indicate whether or not to perform the destroy event for the
current object and the creation event for the new object.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_destroy.bmp"> Destroy
Instance</b><br>
With this action you destroy the current instance. The destroy
event for the instance is executed.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_killposition.bmp"> Destroy at
Position</b><br>
With this action you destroy all instances whose bounding box
contains a given position. This is useful, for example, when you
use an exploding bomb. When you check the <b>Relative</b> box the
position is taken relative to the position of the current
instance.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_sprite.bmp"> Change Sprite</b><br>
Use this action to change the sprite for the instance. You indicate
which new sprite. You can also indicate with subimage must be
shown. Normally you would use 0 for this (the first subimage)
unless you want to see a particular subimage. Use -1 if you do not
want to change the current subimage shown. Finally you change the
speed of the animation of the subimages. If you only want to see a
particular subimage, set the speed to 0. If the speed is larger
than one subimages will be skipped. If it is smaller than 1
subimages will be shown multiple times. Don't use a negative speed.
Changing sprites is an important feature. For example, often you
want to change the sprite of a character depending on the direction
in which it walks. This can be achieved by making different sprites
for each of the (four) directions. Within the keyboard events for
the arrow keys you set the direction of motion and the sprite.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_spritetransform.bmp"> Transform
Sprite</b><br>
Use this action to change the size and orientation of the sprite
for the instance. Use the scale factors to make it larger or
smaller. The angle gives the counter-clockwise orientation of the
sprite. For example, to make the sprite oriented in the direction
of motion use as a value <tt>direction</tt>. For example, this is
useful for a car. You can also indicate whether the sprite should
be mirrored horizontally and/or flipped vertically. <b><i>This
action is only available in the Standard Edition.</i></b></p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_spritecolor.bmp"> Color
Sprite</b><br>
Normally the sprite is drawn as it is defined. Using this action
you can change the color of the sprite. This color is blended with
the sprite, that is, it is combined with the colors of the sprite.
If you want to draw a sprite in different colors you better define
the sprite in black and white and use the blend color to set the
actual color. You can also indicate an alpha transparency. With a
value of 1 the sprite is opaque. With a value of 0 it is completely
transparent. With a value in between you will partially see the
background shine through it. This is great for making explosions.
<b><i>This action is only available in the Standard
Edition.</i></b></p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_sound.bmp"> Play Sound</b><br>
With this action you play one of the sound resources you added to
your game. You can select the sound you want to play and choose
whether it should play only once (the default) or loop
continuously. Multiple wave sounds can play at once but only one
midi sound can play at a time. So if you start a midi sound, the
current midi sound is stopped.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_soundend.bmp"> Stop Sound</b><br>
This action stops the indicated sound. If multiple instances of
this sound are playing all are stopped.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_ifsound.bmp"> Check Sound</b><br>
If the indicated sound is playing the next action is performed.
Otherwise it is skipped. You can select <b>Not</b> to indicate that
the next action should be performed if the indicated sound is not
playing. For example, you can check whether some background music
is playing and, if not, start some new background music. Note that
this action returns true when the sound actually plays through the
speakers. After you call the action to play a sound it does not
immediately reach the speakers so the action might still return
false for a while. Similar, when the sound is stopped you still
hear it for a while (e.g. because of echo) and the action will
still return true.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_roomprevious.bmp"> Previous
Room</b><br>
Move to the previous room. You can indicate the type of transition
effect between the rooms. You should experiment to see what works
best for you. When the rooms do not have the same size you better
do not use transitions. If you are in the first room you get an
error.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_roomnext.bmp"> Next Room</b><br>
Move to the next room. You can indicate the transition.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_roomcurrent.bmp"> Restart
Room</b><br>
The current room is restarted. You indicate the transition
effect.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_roomother.bmp"> Different
Room</b><br>
With this action you can go to a particular room. You indicate the
room and the transition effect.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_ifroomprevious.bmp"> Check
Previous</b><br>
This action tests whether the previous room exists. If so, the next
action is executed. You normally need this test before moving to
the previous room.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_ifroomnext.bmp"> Check Next</b><br>
This action tests whether the next room exists. If so, the next
action is executed. You normally need this test before moving to
the next room.</p>
