<h3>Move actions</h3>
The first set of actions consists of those related to movement of
objects. The following actions exist:

<p><b><img src="images/action_move1.bmp"> Move Fixed</b><br>
Use this action to start the instance moving in a particular
direction. You can indicate the direction using the buttons with
the arrows on it. Use the middle button to stop the motion. Also
you need to specify the speed of the motion. This speed is given in
pixels per step. Preferably don't use negative speeds. You can
specify multiple directions. In this case a random choice is made.
In this way you can let a monster start moving either left or
right.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_move2.bmp"> Move Free</b><br>
This is the second way to specify a motion. Here you can indicate a
precise direction. This is an angle between 0 and 360 degrees. 0
means to the right. The direction is counter-clockwise. So for
example 90 indicates an upward direction. If you want an arbitrary
direction, you can type <tt>random(360)</tt>. As you will see below
the function <tt>random</tt> gives a random number smaller than the
indicated value. As you might have noticed there is a checkbox
labeled <b>Relative</b>. If you check this, the new motion is added
to the previous one. For example, if the instance is moving upwards
and you add some motion to the left, the new motion will be upwards
to the left.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_movepoint.bmp"> Move Towards</b><br>
This action gives a third way to specify a motion. You indicate a
position and a speed and the instance starts moving with the speed
towards the position. (It won't stop at the position!) For example,
if you want a bullet to fly towards the position of the spaceship
you can use as position <tt>spaceship.x, spaceship.y</tt>. (You
will learn more about the use of variables like these below.) If
you check the <b>Relative</b> box, you specify the position
relative to the current position of the instance. (The speed is not
taken relatively!)</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_hspeed.bmp"> Speed Horizontal</b><br>
The speed of an instance consists of a horizontal part and a
vertical part. With this action you can change the horizontal
speed. A positive horizontal speed means a motion to the right. A
negative one means a motion to the left. The vertical speed will
remain the same. Use relative to increase the horizontal speed (or
decrease it by providing a negative number).</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_vspeed.bmp"> Speed Vertical</b><br>
In a similar way, with this action you can change the vertical
speed of the instance.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_gravity.bmp"> Set Gravity</b><br>
With this action you can create gravity for this particular object.
You specify a direction (angle between 0 and 360 degrees) and a
speed, and in each step this amount of speed in the given direction
is added to the current motion of the object instance. Normally you
need a very small speed increment (like 0.01). Typically you want a
downward direction (270 degrees). If you check the <b>Relative</b>
box you increase the gravity speed and direction. Note that,
contrary to real life, different object can have different gravity
directions.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_hreverse.bmp"> Reverse
Horizontal</b><br>
With this action you reverse the horizontal motion of the instance.
This can for example be used when the object collides with a
vertical wall.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_vreverse.bmp"> Reverse
Vertical</b><br>
With this action you reverse the vertical motion of the instance.
This can for example be used when the object collides with a
horizontal wall.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_friction.bmp"> Set Friction</b><br>
Friction slows down the instances when they move. You specify the
amount of friction. In each step this amount is subtracted from the
speed until the speed becomes 0. Normally you want a very small
number here (like 0.01).</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_jumpposition.bmp"> Jump to
Position</b><br>
Using this action you can place the instance in a particular
position. You simply specify the x- and y-coordinate, and the
instance is placed with its reference point on that position. If
you check the <b>Relative</b> box, the position is relative to the
current position of the instance. This action is often used to
continuously move an instance. In each step we increment the
position a bit.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_jumpstart.bmp"> Jump to Start</b><br>
This action places the instance back at the position where it was
created.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_jumprandom.bmp"> Jump to
Random</b><br>
This action moves the instance to a random position in the room.
Only positions are chosen where the instance does not intersect any
solid instance. You can specify the snapping used. If you specify
positive values, the coordinates chosen with be integer multiples
of the indicated values. This could for example be used to keep the
instance aligned with the cells in your game (if any). You can
specify a separate horizontal snapping and vertical snapping.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_grid.bmp"> Align to Grid</b><br>
With this action you can round the position of the instance to a
grid. You can indicate both the horizontal and vertical snapping
value (that is, the size of the cells of the grid). This can be
very useful to make sure that instances stay on a grid.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_wrap.bmp"> Wrap Screen</b><br>
With this action you can let an instance wrap around, that is, when
it leaves on one side of the room it reappears at the other side.
This action is normally used in the <b>Outside</b> event. Note that
the instance must have a speed for wrapping to work, cause the
direction of wrapping is based on the direction of the motion. You
can indicate whether to wrap only horizontal, only vertical, or in
both directions.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_contact.bmp"> Move to Contact</b><br>
With this action you can move the instance in a given direction
until a contact position with an object is reached. If there
already is a collision at the current position the instance is not
moved. Otherwise, the instance is placed just before a collision
occurs. You can specify the direction but also a maximal distance
to move. For example, when the instance is falling you can move a
maximal distance down until an object is encountered. You can also
indicate whether to consider solid object only or all objects. You
typically put this action in the collision event to make sure that
the instance stops in contact with the other instance involved in
the collision.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_bounce.bmp"> Bounce</b><br>
When you put this action in the collision event with some object,
the instance bounces back from this object in a natural way. If you
set the parameter precise to false, only horizontal and vertical
walls are treated correctly. When you set precise to true also
slanted (and even curved) walls are treated correctly. This is
though slower. Also you can indicate whether to bounce only against
solid objects or against all objects. Please realize that the
bounce is not completely accurate because this depends on many
properties. But in many situations the effect is good enough.</p>
