<h3>Deactivating instances</h3>
<b><i>Please be aware that deactivating and activating instances
can sometimes lead to unexpected problems. So you are strongly
advised not to use this feature except for very simple situation
like the ones described below. The feature is mainly left in for
backward compatibility.</i></b>
<p>When you create large room, for example in platform games, with
a small view, many instances lie outside the view. Such instances
though are still active and will execute their events. Also when
performing collision checks these instances are taken into account.
This can cost a lot of time, which is often not necessary. (For
example, often it is not important whether instances outside the
view move.) To solve this problem <i>Game Maker</i> contains some
functions to deactivate and activate instances. Before using them
you must though clearly understand how they work.</p>

<p>When you deactivate instances they are in some sense removed
from the game. They are not visible anymore nor are any events
executed for them. So for all actions and functions they don't
exist anymore. This saves a lot of time but you have to be careful.
For example, when you delete all instances of a particular type,
deactivated instances are not deleted (because they don't exist).
So don't think that a key a player picks up can unlock a
deactivated door. Also persistent deactivated instances are
<b>not</b> moved over to the next room (even though they are
persistent). Also make sure that after you deactivate an instance
that you no longer execute code for it. This can in particular
happen when an instance deactivates itself. In general you better
never have an instance deactivate itself.</p>

<p>The most crucial mistake you can make is to deactivate the
instance that is responsible for the activation. To avoid this some
of the routines below allow you to insist that the calling instance
should not be deactivated itself.</p>

<p>Here are the available routines:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>instance_deactivate_all(notme)</b></tt>
Deactivates all instances in the room. If notme is true the calling
instance is not deactivated (which is normally what you want).<br>
<tt><b>instance_deactivate_object(obj)</b></tt> Deactivates all
instances in the room of the given object. You can also use all to
indicate that all instances must be deactivated or the id of an
instance to deactivate an individual instance.<br>
<tt><b>instance_deactivate_region(left,top,width,height,inside,notme)</b></tt>
Deactivates all instances in the indicated region (that is, those
whose bounding box lies partially inside the region). If inside is
false the instances completely outside the region are deactivated.
If notme is true the calling instance is not deactivated (which is
normally what you want).<br>
<tt><b>instance_activate_all()</b></tt> Activates all instances in
the room.<br>
<tt><b>instance_activate_object(obj)</b></tt> Activates all
instances in the room of the given object. You can also use all to
indicate that all instances must be activated or the id of an
instance to activate an individual instance.<br>
<tt><b>instance_activate_region(left,top,width,height,inside)</b></tt>
Activates all instances in the indicated region. If inside is false
the instances completely outside the region are
activated.<br></blockquote>

<p>For example, to deactivate all instances outside the view and
activate the ones inside the view, you could place the following
code in the step event of the moving character:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  instance_activate_all();
  instance_deactivate_region(view_xview[0],view_yview[0],
                        view_wview[0],view_hview[0],false,true);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In practice you might want to use a region slightly larger than
the view.</p>

<script type="text/JavaScript">
var fe = FindFrame("toc", top);
if ((fe != null) && (chmtop.c2wtopf.jstree != null)) {
  if (chmtop.c2wtopf.FITEMS[chmtop.c2wtopf.pagenum] != chmtop.c2wtopf.pageid)
    chmtop.c2wtopf.jstree.OpenTreeNode("" + chmtop.c2wtopf.pageid);
}
