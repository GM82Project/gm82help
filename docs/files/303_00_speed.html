<h1>Speed considerations</h1>
If you are making complicated games you probably want to make them
run as fast as possible. Even though <i>Game Maker</i> does its
best to make games run fast, a lot depends on how you design your
game. Also, it is rather easy to make games that use large amounts
of memory. In this page we give some hints on how to make your
games faster and smaller.

<p>First of all, look carefully at the sprites and backgrounds you
use. Animated sprites take a lot of memory and drawing lots of
sprites takes a lot of time. So make your sprites as small as
possible. Remove any invisible area around it (the command
<b>Crop</b> in the sprite editor does that automatically). The same
applies to background images. If you have a covering background,
make sure you switch off the use of a background color.</p>

<p>If you use full screen mode, make sure the size of the room (or
window) is never larger than the screen size. Most graphics cards
can efficiently scale images up but they are more slow in scaling
images down! Whenever possible, switch off the cursor. It slows
down the graphics.</p>

<p>Also be careful with the use of many views. For each view the
room is redrawn.</p>

<p>Besides the graphics, there are also other aspects that
influence the speed. Make sure you have as few instances as
possible. In particular, destroy instances once they are no longer
required (e.g. when they leave the room). Avoid lots of work in the
step event or drawing event of instances. Often things do not need
to be checked in each step. Interpretation of code is reasonably
fast, but it is interpreted. Also, some functions and actions take
a lot of time; in particular those that have to check all instances
(like for example the bounce action).</p>

<p>When you need complicated processing (for example for advanced
AI), you better write a DLL for this in a different language and
create an extension package out of this to import the DLL using the
functions described in the page on <a href="414_00_dlls.html">Using
DLL's</a>.</p>

<p>Think about where to treat the collision events. You normally
have two options. Objects that have no collision events are treated
much faster, so preferably treat collisions in those objects of
which there are just a few instances.</p>

<p>Be careful with using large sound files. They take a lot of
memory and also compress badly. You might want to check your sounds
and see whether you can sample them down.</p>

<p>Finally, if you want to make a game that many people can play,
make sure you test it on a number of different machines, in
particular also older machines.</p>
