<h1>Distributing your game</h1>
With the information in the preceding chapters you can create your
games. When your game is finished you obviously want other people
to play it. You can of course give them the .gm81 file that you
created and let them use <i>Game Maker</i> to play it but this is
normally not what you want. First of all, you don't want others to
be able to change the game, and secondly you also want people to
play the game even if they do not have <i>Game Maker</i>. So you
would like to create a stand-alone executable of your game.

<p>Creating stand-alone executables is very easy in <i>Game
Maker</i>. In the <b>File</b> menu you select the item <b>Create
Executable</b>. You will be asked for the name of the executable
that should contain the game. Indicate a name, press <b>OK</b> and
you have your stand-alone game that you can give to anyone you
like. You can change the icon for the stand-alone game in the
<b>Global Game Settings</b>. See <a href="300_index.html">Part
3</a> for details.</p>

<p>Once you have created a stand-alone executable in the way
described above you can give this file to other people or place it
on your website to download. You are free to distribute the games
you create with <i>Game Maker</i> in any way you like. You can even
sell them. This of course assumes that the sprites, images, and
sounds you use can be distributed or sold as well. See the enclosed
license agreement for more information.</p>

<p>It is normally useful to zip your executable, together with some
readme information. In Windows XP and later this can be done
directly through the right mouse button menu, and there are many
free zip utilities available on the web. Alternatively you can
create an installer for your game. Again, a large number of free
installation creation programs are available on the web.</p>

<p>If you want your game to be played by many more people we
recommend you to upload it to the <a href=
"http://www.yoyogames.com/">YoYo Games website</a> and press on the
Share button at the top.</p>
