<h1>More about backgrounds</h1>
In advanced more there are a number of additional options for
background. First of all, a new button <b>Save Background</b> has
appeared. With this button you can save the background in a
proprietary format. This will not only store the image itself but
also for example information about the tiles (see below). These
files will have the extension .gmbck. You can load them in <i>Game
Maker</i> and while running a game. Also you can also change a
background or create your own backgrounds by pressing the button
labeled <b>Edit Background</b>. A built-in image editor opens that
has many features. Please realize that this is not a full-blown
program and if you require more advanced editing tools you might
want to use a separate drawing program. For more information on how
to use the image editor see the section on <a href=
"202_03_individual.html">Editing images</a>.

<p>Sometimes you want to use a background as a set of tiles, that
is, a collection of smaller images in one big image. When create
the rooms you can then add these subimages at different places in
the room. This is very useful for creating nice looking levels. To
use a background as a tile set, check the box labelled <b>Use as
tile set</b>. The form now changes to look as follows:</p>

<p><img src="images/form_background_advanced.jpg">
</p>

<p>You can indicate a number of settings for the tile set. In
particular you can indicate the width and height of each tile.
(Only one size can be given, so better make sure that all tiles in
the set have the same size. If you have different sizes, create two
or more tile sets.) You can also indicate an offset where the top
leftmost tile starts. Finally, a separation between the tiles (this
is normally 0 or 1) can be indicated. For more information on using
tiles, see the section on <a href="210_02_tiles.html">Adding
Tiles</a> when creating rooms.</p>

<p>A word of warning is required here. When you put separating
borders between the sprites and use interpolation between pixels
(see the global game settings) this can result in cracks between
the tiles. Better make sure the pixels around the tiles actually
match with the pixels just inside the tiles to avoid this. You can
easily achieve this by editing the background and changing the
color of such pixels.</p>
