<h1>Upgrading to the Standard Edition</h1>
<i>Game Maker</i> comes in two editions, the Lite Edition and
Standard Edition.

<p>The <b>Lite Edition</b> is meant for those that take their first
steps on the path of developing games. It can be used for free but
is limited in its functionality. Also it shows a popup logo when
running games and will regularly remind you of upgrading the
program. When you are using <i>Game Maker</i> regularly you are
strongly recommended to upgrade from the Lite Edition.</p>

<p><b>Standard Edition</b> contains considerably more functionality
and does not display any logos or popup messages. More precisely,
Standard Edition has the following additional functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li>No <i>Game Maker</i> logo is shown when running a game.</li>

<li>No <i>Game Maker</i> TV logo in the corner of a game.</li>

<li>No <i>Game Maker</i> advert screen on exit.</li>

<li>No regular popups remind you of upgrading.</li>

<li>You can use color blended sprites, which can be used for many
special effects and easy shadows.</li>

<li>There are additional options in the sprite and image
editors.</li>

<li>There are additional actions for e.g. CD music, rotated text,
and colorized shapes.</li>

<li>You can use special sound effects and positional sound.</li>

<li>You can create splash screens with movies, images, webpages,
texts, etc.</li>

<li>There is a particle system to create explosions, fireworks,
flames, rain, and other effects.</li>

<li>A number of advanced drawing functions are available, for
example colorized text and textured polygons.</li>

<li>It is possible to create 3D games using functions for 3D
graphics.</li>

<li>It is possible to create multiplayer games that can be played
over a network.</li>

<li>You can define your own room transitions.</li>

<li>You can use functions to create, load, and modify resources
(sprites, backgrounds, etc.) while the game is running.</li>

<li>There is a collection of functions to create and use data
structures.</li>

<li>There are functions for motion planning.</li>

<li>You get the possibility to include additional files in the game
executables that can be used when the game is run.</li>

<li>Standard Edition can be easily extended using extension
package. These can be made by everybody and will in general be
provided free of charge.</li>

<li>Three such extension packages are included adding many room
transitions, windows dialogs, and printing facilities.</li>

<li>You can define your own trigger events.</li>

<li>You can export and import resources, which makes it easier to
collaborate on games.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upgrading from Lite Edition costs only $39.99 (subject to
change). This is a one-time fee that will be valid for all versions
8.x of <i>Game Maker</i>.</p>

<p>When you are running the Lite Edition, you can upgrade to
Standard by using the welcoming screen when you open Game
Maker.<br>
To upgrade from the e Welcome screen, simply click the <b>Purchase
Now!</b> button, then proceed through the purchase process. Once
you have completed purchase, you will be shown your new license
which you can copy and paste into the text box in Step 2, and click
the <b>Upgrade Now!</b> button. Game Maker will then upgrade to the
full Standard Edition.<br>
<br>
The license file will also be emailed to you using the email
address you type in during purchase, and if you've logged into YoYo
Games store, it will also be tied to that account, allowing you to
retrieve it at any time. If you don't login, the email will also
contain details of a new account setup using the email address you
provided. This will again let you retrieve your Game Maker License
code.<br>
<br>
Please make sure you save the email, and the code itself, as you
will need it anytime you want to reinstall Game Maker.</p>

<p><img src="images/lite_welcome.jpg">
</p>

<p>You caYou can bring this dialog up again by selecting the
<b>Purchase Upgrade from Lite Edition...</b> menu item, as shown
below.</p>

<p><img src="images/form_upgrade.jpg">
</p>

<p>If you purchased <i>Game Maker</i> before (and hence, have an
license key), you can go to the Help menu, and pick <b>Enter
License Key</b>. Once you have entered a valid, your copy of
<i>Game Maker</i> will be upgraded. You must be connected to the
internet for the upgrade to work.</p>

<p>While <i>Game Maker</i> itself does not require an internet
connection, it will require occasional access to maintain the
license. If you can not connect your computer to the internet, you
can download the license check file from YoYo Games website, and
point the auto update system to it. if you fail to provide a valid
file, or an internet connection when requested, your copy of
<i>Game Maker</i> will be downgraded to Lite until such time as you
do.</p>
