<h3>3D sound</h3>
<i><b>This functionality is only available in the Standard Edition
of Game Maker.</b></i>
<p>3D sounds refers to sound that has a position (and velocity)
with respect to the listener. Although its most prominent use is in
3D games you can also effectively use it in 2D games. The idea is
that a sound has a position in space. In all functions the listener
is assumed to be at position (0,0,0). The system calculates how the
listener would hear the sound and adapt it accordingly. The effect
is especially good when you have a good speaker system but is
already works on small speakers.</p>

<p>Besides a position, the sound can also has a velocity. This
leads to well-known doppler effects which are correctly modelled.
Finally the sound can have an orientation and, again, the sound is
adapted accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Game Maker</i> supports 3D sound options through the
functions below. They only work for sound resources that were
indicated to be 3D. (The disadvantage is that 3D sounds will be
mono, not stereo.)</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>sound_3d_set_sound_position(snd,x,y,z)</b></tt>
Sets the position of the indicated sound with respect to the
listener to the indicated position in space. Values on the x-axis
increase from left to right, on the y-axis from down to up, and on
the z-axis from near to far. The values are measured in meters. The
volume with which the sound is heard depends on this measure in the
same way as in the real world.<br>
<tt><b>sound_3d_set_sound_velocity(snd,x,y,z)</b></tt> Sets the
velocity of the indicated sound to the indicated vector in space.
Please note that setting the velocity does not mean that the
position changes. The velocity is only used for calculating doppler
effects. So if you want to move the sound you must yourself change
the position of the sound.<br>
<tt><b>sound_3d_set_sound_distance(snd,mindist,maxdist)</b></tt>
Sets the minimum distance at which the sound does no longer
increase in loudness and the maximum distance at which the sound
can no longer be heard. So when the distance lies between 0 and the
minimum distance the sound is at maximal amplitude. When between
the minimal distance and the maximal distance the amplitude slowly
decreases until either the maximal distance is reached or the sound
is anyway no longer audible. Default the minimum distance is 1
meter and the maximal distance is 1 billion meters.<br>
<tt><b>sound_3d_set_sound_cone(snd,x,y,z,anglein,angleout,voloutside)</b></tt>
Normally sound has the same amplitude at a given distance in all
directions. You can set the sound cone to change this and make
sound directional. x,y,z specify the direction of the sound cone.
<tt>anglein</tt> specifies the inside angle. If the listener is
inside this angle it hears the sound at its normal volume.
<tt>angleout</tt> specifies the outside angle. When the listener is
outside this the volume is indicated with <tt>voloutside</tt>. To
be precise, <tt>voloutside</tt> is a negative number that indicates
the number of hundreds of decibel that must be subtracted from the
inside volume. Between the inside and outside angle the volume
gradually decreases.<br></blockquote>
