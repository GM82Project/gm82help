<h3>Going to 3D mode</h3>
If you want to use 3D mode you first need to set <i>Game Maker</i>
in 3D mode. You can later switch back to 2D mode if you want. The
following two functions exist for this.

<blockquote><tt><b>d3d_start()</b></tt> Start using 3D mode.
Returns whether successful.<br>
<tt><b>d3d_end()</b></tt> Stop using 3D mode. Returns whether
successful.<br></blockquote>

<p>Note that all functions related to 3D mode start with
<tt>d3d_</tt>.</p>

<p>Starting 3D mode will result in the following changes. First of
all depth testing (also known as Z Buffering) is switched on (using
a 24-bit z-buffer). This means that for each pixel on the screen
only the drawing with the smallest z-value (= depth value) is
drawn. If instances have the same depth then you will get what is
known as Z-fighting. This occurs as the 2 instances attempt to draw
at the same level, and inaccuracys in the rendering due to very
close Z value cause ugly effects. To avoid this, try and make sure
instances that might overlap do not have the same depth value!</p>

<p>Secondly, the normal orthographic projection is replaced by a
perspective one. This means the following. Normally the size of
instances on the screen is independent on its depth. With a
perspective projection instances that have a greater depth will
appear smaller. When the depth is 0 it is equal to the old size
(unless you change the projection; see below). The viewpoint for
the camera is placed at a distance above the room. (This distance
is equal to the width of the room; that gives a reasonable default
projection.) Only instances in front of the camera are drawn. So
don't use instances with a depth smaller than 0 (or at least not
smaller than -w where w is the width of the room or the view).</p>

<p>Thirdly, the vertical y-coordinate is reversed. While normally
the (0,0) position is at the top-left of the view, in 3D mode the
(0,0) position is at the bottom-left position, as is normal for
3-dimensional views.</p>

<p>You can actually switch hidden surface remove and perspective
projection on or off using the following functions.</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>d3d_set_hidden(enable)</b></tt> Enables (true)
or disables (false) depth testing.<br>
<tt><b>d3d_set_perspective(enable)</b></tt> Enables the use of a
perspective projection (true) or disables it
(false).<br></blockquote>

  if (chmtop.c2wtopf.FITEMS[chmtop.c2wtopf.pagenum] != chmtop.c2wtopf.pageid)
    chmtop.c2wtopf.jstree.OpenTreeNode("" + chmtop.c2wtopf.pageid);
