<h1>Game information</h1>
A good game provides the player with some information on how to
play the game. This information is displayed when the player
presses the &lt;F1&gt; key during game play. <i>Game Maker</i> has
a simple built-in mechanism to provide game help. However, it is
limited in functionality. To create nicer games it is better to
create the help yourself using special rooms or by using splash
screen with e.g. html pages.

<p>To create the simple game information, double click <b>Game
Information</b> in the resource tree at the left of the screen. A
little built-in editor is opened where you can edit the game
information. You can use different fonts, different colors, and
styles. Also you can set the background color.</p>

<p><img src="images/form_help.jpg">
</p>

<p>In the <b>File</b> menu you can also set a number of
<b>Options</b>. Default the help is shown in the game window and
game play is temporarily halted. Here you can indicate to show the
help file in a separate window. In this case you can indicate the
caption of the game information during the game. Also you can
indicate the position (use -1 for centered) and size of the game
information window and whether it should have a border and be
sizeable by the player. You can force the information window to
stay on top and you can indicate whether the game should continue
playing while the information is shown.</p>

<p>Good advice is to make the information short but precise. Of
course you should add your name because you created the game. All
example games provided have an information file about the game and
how it was created. You might want to indicate at the bottom of the
help file that the user must press Escape to continue playing.)</p>

<p>If you want to make a bit more fancy help, use a program like
Word. Then select the part you want and use copy and paste to move
it from Word to the game information editor. For more advanced
games though you probably will not use this mechanism at all but
use some dedicated rooms to show help about the game.</p>
