<h3>Score actions</h3>
In most games the player will have a certain score. Also many games
give the player a number of lives. Finally, often the player has a
certain health. The following actions make it easy to deal with the
score, lives, and health of the player.

<p><b><img src="images/action_score.bmp"> Set Score</b><br>
<i>Game Maker</i> has a built-in score mechanism. The score is
normally displayed in the window caption. You can use this action
to change the score. You simply provide the new value for the
score. Often you want to add something to the score. In this case
don't forget the check the <b>Relative</b> box.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_ifscore.bmp"> Test Score</b><br>
With this question action you can check whether the score has
reached a particular value. You indicate the value and whether the
score should be equal to that value, be smaller than the value or
be larger than the value.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_drawscore.bmp"> Draw Score</b><br>
With this action you can draw the value of the score at a
particular position on the screen. You provide the positions and
the caption that must be placed in front of the score. The score is
drawn in the current font. This action can only be used in the
drawing event of an object.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_highscore.bmp"> Show
Highscore</b><br>
For each game the top ten scores are maintained. This action
displays the highscore list. If the current score is among the top
ten, the new score is inserted and the player can type his or her
name. You can indicate what background image to use, whether the
window should have a border, what the color for the new entry and
the other entries must be, and which font to use.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_highscoreclear.bmp"> Clear
Highscore</b><br>
This action clears the highscore table.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_lives.bmp"> Set Lives</b><br>
<i>Game Maker</i> also has a built-in lives system. With this
action you can change the number of lives left. Normally you set it
to some value like 3 at the beginning of the game and then decrease
or increase the number depending on what happens. Don't forget to
check the <b>Relative</b> box if you want to add or subtract from
the number of lives. At the moment the number of lives becomes 0
(or smaller than 0) a "no more lives" event is generated.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_iflives.bmp"> Test Lives</b><br>
With this question action you can check whether the number of lives
has reached a particular value. You indicate the value and whether
the number of lives should be equal to that value, be smaller than
the value or be larger than the value.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_drawlives.bmp"> Draw Lives</b><br>
With this action you can draw the number of lives at a particular
position on the screen. You provide the positions and the caption
that must be placed in front of the number of lives. The number of
lives is drawn in the current font. This action can only be used in
the drawing event of an object.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_drawlivesimage.bmp"> Draw Life
Images</b><br>
Rather than drawing the number of lives left as a number, it is
often nicer to use a number of small images for this. This action
does precisely that. You specify the position and the image and at
the indicated position the number of lives is drawn as images. This
action can only be used in the drawing event of an object.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_health.bmp"> Set Health</b><br>
<i>Game Maker</i> has a built-in health mechanism. You can use this
action to change the health. A value of 100 is considered full
health and 0 is no health at all. You simply provide the new value
for the health. Often you want to subtract something from the
health. In this case don't forget the check the <b>Relative</b>
box. When the health becomes smaller or equal to 0 an out of health
event is generated.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_ifhealth.bmp"> Test Health</b><br>
With this question action you can check whether the health has
reached a particular value. You indicate the value and whether the
health should be equal to that value, be smaller than the value or
be larger than the value.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_drawhealth.bmp"> Draw Health</b><br>
With this action you can draw the health in the form of a health
bar. When the health is 100 the full bar is drawn. When it is 0 the
bar is empty. You indicate the position and size of the health bar
and the color of the bar and the background.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/action_caption.bmp"> Score Caption</b><br>
Normally in the window caption the name of the room and the score
is displayed. With this action you can change this. You can
indicate whether or not to show the score, lives, and/or health and
what the caption for each of these must be.</p>

<script type="text/JavaScript">
var fe = FindFrame("toc", top);
if ((fe != null) && (chmtop.c2wtopf.jstree != null)) {
  if (chmtop.c2wtopf.FITEMS[chmtop.c2wtopf.pagenum] != chmtop.c2wtopf.pageid)
    chmtop.c2wtopf.jstree.OpenTreeNode("" + chmtop.c2wtopf.pageid);
}
