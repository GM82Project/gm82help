<h3>Graphics options</h3>
In this tab you can set a number of options that are related to the
graphical appearance of your game. It is normally useful to check
out the effects of these options because they can have a
significant effect on the way the game looks. Remember though that
different users have different machines. So better make sure that
the settings also work on other peoples machines.

<p><b>Start in fullscreen mode</b><br>
When checked the game runs in the full screen; otherwise it runs in
a window.</p>

<p><b>Scaling</b><br>
Here you can indicate what happens when the window is larger than
the room or when the game is run in full-screen mode. There are
three choices. You can indicate a fixed scaling. The room is drawn
scaled with the given amount in the center of the window or the
center of the screen. 100 indicates no scaling. You typically use
fixed scaling when your sprites and rooms are very small. The
second option is scale the room such that it fills the window or
screen but keep the aspect ratio (ratio between width and height)
the same. The third option is to scale such that the window or
screen is completely filled. This can lead to distortions in the
image (in particular in windowed mode when the user can resize the
window).</p>

<p><b>Interpolate colors between pixels</b><br>
When checked, colors of pixels in sprites, backgrounds, and tiles
that are not aligned with pixels on the screen will be
interpolated. This in particular is the case when they are scaled,
rotated, or placed at non-integer positions. Interpolation makes
movement smoother but can also give a blurred effect. (Also for
tiles it can lead to cracks between them, if not carefully
designed.)</p>

<p><b>Color outside the room region</b><br>
When the room does not completely fill the window or screen there
is some area unused around it. Here you can specify the color of
the area.</p>

<p><b>Allow the player to resize the game window</b><br>
When checked in windowed mode the user can change the size of the
game window by dragging with the mouse at its corners.</p>

<p><b>Let the game window always stay on top</b><br>
When checked in windowed mode the game window always stays on top
of other windows.</p>

<p><b>Don't draw a border in windowed mode</b><br>
When checked in windowed mode the game window will not have a
border or a caption bar.</p>

<p><b>Don't show the buttons in the window caption</b><br>
When checked in windowed mode the window caption will not show the
buttons to close the window or to minimize or maximize it.</p>

<p><b>Display the cursor</b><br>
Indicates whether you want the mouse pointer to be visible. Turning
it off is normally faster and nicer. (You can easily make you own
cursor object in <i>Game Maker</i>.)</p>

<p><b>Freeze the game when the form loses focus</b><br>
When checked, whenever the player brings some other form to the top
(e.g. another application) the game freezes until the game window
again gets the focus.</p>

<p><b>Disable screensavers and power saving actions</b><br>
When checked (default) screensavers or power saving actions (sleep,
hibernate) will not activate while the game is running. This is
important as these might destroy certain graphics aspects of the
game (like surfaces).</p>
