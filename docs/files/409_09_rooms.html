<h3>Rooms</h3>
Manipulating rooms on the fly is a dangerous thing to do. You have
to realize that rooms change all the time due to what is happening
in the game. This normally only involves the currently active room
and there are many routines described in previous sections to
manipulate the instances, backgrounds, and tiles in the active
room. But changes in the active room will last if the room is
persistent. Hence, you should never manipulate aspects of the
currently active room or any room that is persistent and that has
already been visited before. Such changes in general won't be
noticed but might sometimes even lead to unexpected errors. Due to
the fact that rooms are linked in a complicated way there is also
no routine to delete a room.

<p>The following routines are available</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>room_set_width(ind,w)</b></tt> Sets the width
for the room with the indicated index.<br>
<tt><b>room_set_height(ind,h)</b></tt> Sets the height for the room
with the indicated index.<br>
<tt><b>room_set_caption(ind,str)</b></tt> Sets the caption for the
room with the indicated index.<br>
<tt><b>room_set_persistent(ind,val)</b></tt> Sets whether the room
with the indicated index is persistent or not.<br>
<tt><b>room_set_code(ind,str)</b></tt> Sets the initialization code
string for the room with the indicated index.<br>
<tt><b>room_set_background_color(ind,col,show)</b></tt> Sets the
color properties for the room with the indicated index if is does
not have a background image. col indicates the color and show
indicates whether the color must be shown or not.<br>
<tt><b>room_set_background(ind,bind,vis,fore,back,x,y,htiled,vtiled,hspeed,vspeed,alpha)</b></tt>
Sets background with index bind (0-7) for the room with the
indicated index. vis indicates whether the background is visible
and fore whether it is actually a foreground. back is the index of
the background image. x,y indicate the position of the image and
htiled and vtiled indicate whether the image must be tiled. hspeed
and vspeed indicate the speed with which the background moves and
alpha indicates an alpha translucency value (1 = solid and
fastest).<br>
<tt><b>room_set_view(ind,vind,vis,xview,yview,wview,hview,xport,yport,wport,hport,hborder,vborder,hspeed,vspeed,obj)</b></tt>
Sets the view with index vind (0-7) for the room with the indicated
index. vis indicates whether the view is visible. xview, yview,
wview, and hview indicate the position of the view in the room.
xport, yport, wport, and hport indicate the position on the screen.
When the view must follow an object hborder and vborder indicate
the minimal visible border that must be kept around the object.
hspeed and vspeed indicate the maximal speed with which the view
can move. obj is the index of the object or the index of the
instance.<br>
<tt><b>room_set_view_enabled(ind,val)</b></tt> Sets whether views
must be enabled for the room with the indicated index.<br>
<tt><b>room_add()</b></tt> Adds a new room. It returns the index of
the room. Note that the room will not be part of the room order. So
the new room does not have a previous or a next room. If you want
to move to an added room you must provide the index of the
room.<br>
<tt><b>room_duplicate(ind)</b></tt> Adds a copy of the room with
the given index. It returns the index of the room.<br>
<tt><b>room_assign(ind,room)</b></tt> Assigns the indicated room to
room ind. So this makes a copy of the room.<br>
<tt><b>room_instance_add(ind,x,y,obj)</b></tt> Adds a new instance
of object obj to the room, placing it at the indicate position. It
returns the index of the instance.<br>
<tt><b>room_instance_clear(ind)</b></tt> Removes all instances from
the indicated room.<br>
<tt><b>room_tile_add(ind,back,left,top,width,height,x,y,depth)</b></tt>
Adds a new tile to the room at the indicate position. It returns
the index of the tile. back is the background from which the tile
is taken. left, top, width and height indicate the part of the
background that forms the tile. x,y is the position of the tile in
the room and depth is the depth of the tile.<br>
<tt><b>room_tile_add_ext(ind,back,left,top,width,height,x,y,depth,xscale,yscale,alpha)</b></tt>
Same as the previous routine but this time you can also specify a
scaling factor in x and y direction and an alpha transparency for
the tile.<br>
<tt><b>room_tile_clear(ind)</b></tt> Removes all tiles from the
indicated room.<br></blockquote>
