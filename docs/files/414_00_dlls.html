<h1>Using DLL's</h1>
<i><b>This functionality is only available in the Standard Edition
of Game Maker.</b></i>
<p><i><b>Please note that since version 7 there is a new extension
mechanism in Game Maker. You are strongly encouraged to use that
extension mechanism, rather than the functions described in this
section. See <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/extensions" target=
"_blank">http://www.yoyogames.com/extensions</a> for details. These
functions are mainly left in for compatibility with the
past.</b></i>
</p>

<p>In those cases were the functionality of GML is not enough for
your wishes, you can actually extend the possibilities by using
plug-ins. A plug-in comes in the form of a DLL file (a Dynamic Link
Library). In such a DLL file you can define functions. Such
functions can be programmed in any programming language that
supports the creation of DLL's (e.g. Delphi, C, C++, etc.) You will
though need to have some programming skill to do this. Plug-in
functions must have a specific format. They can have between 0 and
16 arguments, each of which can either be a real number (double in
C) or a null-terminated string. (For more than 4 arguments, only
real arguments are supported at the moment.) They must return
either a real or a null-terminated string.</p>

<p>In Delphi you create a DLL by first choosing <b>New</b> from the
<b>File</b> menu and then choosing DLL. Here is an example of a DLL
you can use with <i>Game Maker</i> written in Delphi. (Note that
this is Delphi code, not GML code!)</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
library MyDLL;

uses SysUtils, Classes;

function MyMin(x,y:double):double;  cdecl;
begin
  if x&lt;y then Result := x else Result := y;
end;

var res : array[0..1024] of char;

function DoubleString(str:PChar):PChar; cdecl;
begin
  StrCopy(res,str);
  StrCat(res,str);
  Result := res;
end;

exports MyMin, DoubleString;

begin
end.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This DLL defines two functions: <tt>MyMin</tt> that takes two
real arguments and returns the minimum of the two, and
<tt>DoubleString</tt> that doubles the string. Note that you have
to be careful with memory management. That is why I declared the
resulting string global. Also notice the use of the cdecl calling
convention. You can either use cdecl or stdcall calling
conventions. Once you build the DLL in Delphi you will get a file
<tt>MyDLL.DLL</tt>. This file must be placed in the running
directory of your game. (Or any other place where Windows can find
it.)</p>

<p>To use this DLL in <i>Game Maker</i> you first need to specify
the external functions you want to use and what type of arguments
they take. For this there is the following function in GML:</p>

<blockquote>
<tt><b>external_define(dll,name,calltype,restype,argnumb,arg1type,arg2type,
...)</b></tt> Defines an external function. dll is the name of the
dll file. name is the name of the functions. calltype is the
calling convention used. For this use either dll_cdecl or
dll_stdcall. restype is the type of the result. For this use either
ty_real or ty_string. argnumb is the number of arguments (0-16).
Next, for each argument you must specify its type. For this again
use either ty_real or ty_string. When there are more than 4
arguments all of them must be of type ty_real.<br></blockquote>

<p>This function returns the id of the external function that must
be used for calling it. So in the above example, at the start of
the game you would use the following GML code:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  global.mmm = external_define('MyDLL.DLL','MyMin',dll_cdecl,
                                     ty_real,2,ty_real,ty_real);
  global.ddd = external_define('MyDLL.DLL','DoubleString',dll_cdecl,
                                     ty_string,1,ty_string);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Now whenever you need to call the functions, you use the
following function:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>external_call(id,arg1,arg2,...)</b></tt> Calls
the external function with the given id, and the given arguments.
You need to provide the correct number of arguments of the correct
type (real or string). The function returns the result of the
external function.<br></blockquote>

<p>So, for example, you would write:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  aaa = external_call(global.mmm,x,y);
  sss = external_call(global.ddd,'Hello');
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don't need to use the DLL anymore you had better free
it.</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>external_free(dll)</b></tt> Frees the DLL with
the given name. This is in particular necessary if the game should
remove the DLL. As long as the DLL is not freed it cannot be
removed. Best do this e.g. in an end of game
event.<br></blockquote>

<p>You might wonder how to make a function in a DLL that does
something in the game. For example, you might want to create a DLL
that adds instances of objects to your game. The easiest way is to
let your DLL function return a string that contains a piece of GML
code. This string that contains the piece of GML can be executed
using the GML function</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>execute_string(str,arg0,arg1,...)</b></tt>
Execute the piece of code in the string str with the indicated
arguments.<br></blockquote>

<p>Alternatively you can let the DLL create a file with a script
that can be executed (this function can also be used to later
modify the behavior of a game).</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>execute_file(fname)</b></tt> Execute the piece
of code in the file.<br></blockquote>

<p>Now you can call an external function and then execute the
resulting string, e.g. as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  ccc = external_call(global.ddd,x,y);
  execute_string(ccc);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In some rare cases your DLL might need to know the handle of the
main graphics window for the game. This can be obtained with the
following function and can then be passed to the DLL:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>window_handle()</b></tt> Returns the window
handle for the main window.<br></blockquote>

<p>Note that DLLs cannot be used in secure mode.</p>

<p>Using external DLLs is an extremely powerful mechanism. But
please only use it if you know what you are doing.</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>get_function_address('function_name')</b></tt>
Returns the address of a Game Maker function. This can be passed to
DLL's so the can call directly into Game Maker.<br>
This feature is unsuported, so care must be taken when using this
function.<br>
<b>Please Note: These functions use Delphi 2010 PASCAL calling
convention and string formats.</b><br></blockquote>
