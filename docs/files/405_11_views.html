<h3>Views</h3>
As you should know you can define up to eight different views when
designing rooms. A view is defined by its view area in the room and
its viewport on the screen (or to be precise in the drawing region
within the window). Using views you can show different parts of the
room at different places on the screen. Also, you can make sure
that a particular object always stays visible.

<p>You can control the views from within code. You can make views
visible and invisible and change the place or size of the views in
the drawing region or the position and size of the view in the room
(which is in particular useful when you indicate no object to be
visible). You can change the size of the horizontal and vertical
border around the visible object, and you can indicate which object
must remain visible in the views. The latter is very important when
the important object changes during the game. For example, you
might change the main character object based on its current status.
Unfortunately, this does mean that it is no longer the object that
must remain visible. This can be remedied by one line of code in
the creation event of all the possible main objects (assuming this
must happen in the first view):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  view_object[0] = object_index;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The following variables exist that influence the view. All,
except the first two are arrays ranging from 0 (the first view) to
7 (the last view).</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>view_enabled</b></tt> Whether views are enabled
or not.<br>
<tt><b>view_current*</b></tt> The currently drawn view (0-7). Use
this only in the drawing event. You can for example check this
variable to draw certain things in only one view. Variable cannot
be changed.<br>
<tt><b>view_visible[0..7]</b></tt> Whether the particular view is
visible on the screen.

<p><tt><b>view_xview[0..7]</b></tt> X position of the view in the
room.<br>
<tt><b>view_yview[0..7]</b></tt> Y position of the view in the
room.<br>
<tt><b>view_wview[0..7]</b></tt> Width of the view in the room.<br>
<tt><b>view_hview[0..7]</b></tt> Height of the view in the
room.<br>
<tt><b>view_xport[0..7]</b></tt> X-position of the viewport in the
drawing region.<br>
<tt><b>view_yport[0..7]</b></tt> Y-position of the viewport in the
drawing region.<br>
<tt><b>view_wport[0..7]</b></tt> Width of the viewport in the
drawing region.<br>
<tt><b>view_hport[0..7]</b></tt> Height of the viewport in the
drawing region.<br>
<tt><b>view_angle[0..7]</b></tt> Rotation angle used for the view
in the room (counter-clockwise in degrees).<br>
<tt><b>view_hborder[0..7]</b></tt> Size of horizontal border around
the visible object (in pixels).<br>
<tt><b>view_vborder[0..7]</b></tt> Size of vertical border around
visible object (in pixels).<br>
<tt><b>view_hspeed[0..7]</b></tt> Maximal horizontal speed of the
view.<br>
<tt><b>view_vspeed[0..7]</b></tt> Maximal vertical speed of the
view.<br>
<tt><b>view_object[0..7]</b></tt> Object whose instance must remain
visible in the view. If there are multiple instances of this object
only the first one is followed. You can also assign an instance id
to this variable. In that case the particular instance is
followed.<br></p></blockquote>

<p>Note that the size of the image on the screen is decided based
on the visible views at the beginning of the room. If you change
views during the game, they might no longer fit on the screen. The
screen size though is not adapted automatically. So if you need
this you have to do it yourself, using the following functions:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>window_set_region_size(w,h,adaptwindow)</b></tt>
Set the width and height of the drawing region in the window.
<tt>adaptwindow</tt> indicates whether the window size must be
adapted if the region does not fit in. The window size will always
be adapted if you use fixed scaling. (See the function
<tt>window_set_region_scale()</tt>.)<br>
<tt><b>window_get_region_width()</b></tt> Returns the current width
of the drawing region.<br>
<tt><b>window_get_region_height()</b></tt> Returns the current
height of the drawing region.<br></blockquote>

<p>In a game you often need the position of the mouse cursor.
Normally you use for this the variables <tt>mouse_x</tt> and
<tt>mouse_y</tt>. When there are multiple views, these variables
give the mouse position with respect to the view the mouse is in.
Sometimes though, you might need the mouse position with respect to
a particular view, also when it is outside that view. For this the
following functions exist.</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>window_view_mouse_get_x(id)</b></tt> Returns the
x-coordinate of the mouse with respect to the view with index
id.<br>
<tt><b>window_view_mouse_get_y(id)</b></tt> Returns the
y-coordinate of the mouse with respect to the view with index
id.<br>
<tt><b>window_view_mouse_set(id,x,y)</b></tt> Sets the position of
the mouse with respect to the view with index id.<br>
<tt><b>window_views_mouse_get_x()</b></tt> Returns the x-coordinate
of the mouse with respect to the view it is in (same as
<tt>mouse_x</tt>).<br>
<tt><b>window_views_mouse_get_y()</b></tt> Returns the y-coordinate
of the mouse with respect to the view it is in (same as
<tt>mouse_y</tt>).<br>
<tt><b>window_views_mouse_set(x,y)</b></tt> Sets the position of
the mouse with respect to the first view that is
visible.</blockquote>
