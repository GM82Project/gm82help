<h1>Sound and music</h1>
Sound plays a crucial role in computer games. Sounds are added to
your game in the form of sound resources. Make sure that the names
you use are valid variable names. As you will have seen you can
indicate four different types of sound: normal sounds, background
music, 3D sounds, and sounds that must be played through the media
player.

<p>Normal sounds are used for sound effects. In general wave files
are used for this. Many of them can play at the same moment (even
multiple instances of the same normal sound). You can apply all
sorts of effects to them.</p>

<p>Background music typically consist of midi files but sometimes
also wave files are used. Sound effects can be applied to it. The
only difference with normal sounds is that only one background
music can play at any moment. If you start one the current one is
stopped.</p>

<p>3D sounds allow for 3D sound effects which is described below.
They are mono sounds (wave or midi).</p>

<p>Finally, if you want to use another sound type, in particular
mp3, these cannot be played through DirectX. As a result the normal
media player must be used for this. This is much more limited. Only
one sound can play at the same time. No effects can be applied (not
even volume changes) and the timing for e.g. looping sounds is
poor. There can also be delays in playing these sounds. You are
strongly encouraged not to use them. (Some computers might also not
support them)</p>
