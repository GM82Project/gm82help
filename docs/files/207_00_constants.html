<h1>Constants</h1>
<b><i>This functionality is only available in the Standard Edition
of Game Maker.</i></b>
<p>In advanced mode you can define constants that you can use in
scripts and in values for actions. Each constant has a name and a
value. Names should follow the same rules as variables, that is,
they must start with a letter or underscore symbol and further
consist of letters, digits or underscore symbols. You are though
strongly recommended to make all your constants easily
distinguishable. A usual convention is to use only capital letters
and underscores.</p>

<p>To define constants you chose <b>Define Constants</b> from the
<b>Resources</b> menu. The following form will show (in which
already some constants have been defined):</p>

<p><img src="images/form_constants.jpg">
</p>

<p>At the top you see the constants. At the left there is the name
and at the right the value. You can select the name or value with
the mouse and change it by typing. A value of a constant should be
a constant expression. That is, it is either a constant number or a
string (with quotes around it) or it is an expression. The
expression is evaluated before anything else happens in the game.
So it for example cannot reference the current room, instances, or
scripts. But it can contain the built-in constants and the names of
resources.</p>

<p>You can append a constant at the end of the list using the
button <b>Add</b> (or by pressing Enter) and delete it using
<b>Delete</b>. You can also insert a constant above the current
selected constant. There are also buttons to clear all constants,
to move them up or down in the list, and to sort them by name.</p>

<p>Finally you can save all constants to a text file or load them
from a text file. This is useful when you want to store collections
of useful constants for later use. When loading constants they are
appended to the current list. The text file can also be editor
using a text editor. Each line contains a constant definition of
the form NAME=VALUE.</p>

<p>It is good practise to put any value that you use multiple times
in a constant. Also, if you are not completely sure about a certain
value you better put it in a constant as it is a lot easier to
change the constants than to find the values in the scripts and
actions and change them there.</p>
