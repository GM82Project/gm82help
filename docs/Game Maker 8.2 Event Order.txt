--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Game started
  ------------

- Loading bar is hidden
- Extension initialization
    - Extensions are initialized in alphabetical order.
- Window is created
- Create
- Instance Creation Code*
- Game Start
- Room Creation Code
- Room Start
- Draw

* When the relevant Game Settings checkbox is enabled in 8.2, otherwise they
  execute before Create events. This applies to all cases of this event.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Room Change
  -----------

->  Whenever room_goto*() functions are called, or the 'room' variable is set.

->  The current code action will finish, but any subsequent code actions will
    not be allowed to execute until the new room is loaded. Attempting to change
    the room again or end the game during a room change will cause unintended
    behavior that is not entirely understood.

- If a room transition is set, Draw
- Room End
- New room is loaded
    - Any persistent instances are added to the end of the instance list
- Create
- Instance Creation Code
- Room Creation Code
- Room Start
- Draw
- Transition script is executed 'transition_steps' times


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Frame Event Order
  -----------------

- xprevious and yprevious are updated to x and y
- Early Triggers
- Begin Step
- Timelines count up & run moments
- Alarms count down & run on 0
- Keyboard
- Keyboard Press
- Keyboard Release
- Mouse
- Global Mouse
- Mouse Pressed
- Global Mouse Pressed
- Mouse Released
- Global Mouse Released
- Triggers
- Step
- Instance Update*
    - Friction is applied
    - Gravity is applied
    - Instance is moved to new position
- End Of Path*
- Outside room
- Intersect Boundary
- Collision events
- Late Triggers
- End Step
- Particle systems update
- Destroyed instances are deleted
- Draw*
- Backgrounds are updated
- image_speed is added to image_index*
- Animation End*
    - Executes when image_index wraps around to 0.
    - Does not execute when image_speed is negative.
    - Will execute every step with a single-image sprite or no sprite.
- cursor animation is advanced
- The game window is updated with the new frame and sleeps until the next frame
   
* These events execute by master instance list sorting order. All other events
  are executed by object list order instead. Check the section at the end for
  more details.

  Game Ending
  -----------
  
- Room End
- Game End
- Extension finalization


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Draw Event
  ----------

->  At the start of every draw event (including the ones triggered by room
    transitions), the master instance list is sorted. More details about that
    in the section about instance sorting.

- the window is cleared to the window color, if it's enabled
- views are moved to follow their objects
- for each visible view:*
    - the view is cleared to the background_color, if it's enabled
        - this also results in clearing the z-buffer
    - backgrounds are drawn at 3d depth 12000**
    - instances, tiles and particle systems are drawn in depth order
        - within the same depth, particles are on top of tiles,
          and tiles are on top of instances
    - foregrounds are drawn at 3d depth -12000**
    - the sprite cursor is drawn at 3d depth -13000**
- the window caption is updated to the room_caption

* If views are not enabled, the entire room is drawn instead.
** 3d depth only applies when 3d mode is on. When 3d mode is off, the resulting
   vertex z coordinate of builtin 2d drawing is always 0.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Other Events
  ------------
  
->  Create, User Events, and Destroy events execute immediately when called.
->  Out of Health & Out of Lives events execute once, the moment the variables
    are set to zero or negative values.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Instance Sorting
  ----------------
  
->  Game Maker has a master list of active instances. New instances are always
    added at the end, and a sort is performed at the start of Draw events.

->  Most of these details are not relevant if a game's code is well behaved,
    but for edge cases and exploits, knowing the proper procedures might result
    in easier debugging and more reliable code.

->  Any events that aren't sorted by draw order will instead make use of
    object-specific instance lists, which are completely unsorted, simply being
    ordered by creation. When re-activated, instances are placed at the ends of
    these lists.

- Instances are sorted by depth, in descending order. Larger goes first.
- Within the same depth, it sorts and executes by creation order.
- Instance activation and deactivation take place immediately, removing or
  placing instances at the end of the lists.
- Deactivated instances are moved to a different list, and can't be accessed
  even if you know their id.
    

->  During the brief moment before a draw event, new instances won't be sorted:

- Re-activated instances will sort last, in the order they were activated in.
- Upon entering a room, persistent instances from a previous room will sort
  last, in the order they were in the previous room.
- If any instances are created during the start of a room, those new instances
  will be placed after any persistent instances from a previous room due to
  those events running atfer the persistent instances are appended to the list.
